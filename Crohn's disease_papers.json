In this article, we present a 21-year-old man with gastric outlet obstruction secondary to IGCD. Management with Adalimumab and Upadacitinib failed, however he responded to Risankizumab. To our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting efficacy of Risankizumab in management of IGCD. In addition, we reviewed 13 published case reports describing IGCD. Ninety-two percent of cases were seen in women, typically presenting with nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain. Eighty-five percent of cases progressed to gastric outlet obstruction and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were the first line advanced therapy.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by heterogeneous manifestations with significant morbidities. Diagnosing and managing CD remains challenging due to its variable clinical presentation, complexities in assessing disease extent and activity, and lack of a definitive diagnostic marker. Over the last years, there has been a switch towards a treat-to-target approach in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Capsule endoscopy (CE) has emerged as a non-invasive, complementary tool for CD diagnosis and monitoring. CE is patient friendly being wireless and enables direct visualization of the entire small bowel in one sitting. CE plays a role in the diagnostic workup of suspected CD and in cases of in IBD unclassified (IBDU). In established CD, CE plays a role in monitoring mucosal healing, a key therapeutic target linked to improved long-term outcomes. CE findings significantly influence treatment strategies, leading to therapy escalation, adjustment, or avoidance of unnecessary surgical interventions. Moreover, CE disease activity assessment by means of the Lewis score is able to predict disease flares, thus having also a prognostic role. In conclusion, the non-invasive nature of CE, combined with its diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications, establishes it as an essential tool in the comprehensive management of CD across all disease stages. This review provides a comprehensive update on CE's evolving role in optimizing care of patients with CD.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe management of Crohn's disease (CD) in older-adult patients is challenging due to age-related immune decline, comorbidities, and the excessive risk of adverse effects from pharmacological treatments. The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) has shown promise in treating younger populations, but its effectiveness in older-adults remains understudied. This study aimed to evaluate the CDED effectiveness in older-adults with CD.MethodsA single-center retrospective cohort study, including patients over 60 years old with CD who initiated CDED between 2018 and 2024. Patients were categorized based on baseline disease clinical activity using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Clinical and biochemical outcomes (fecal calprotectin [FCAL] and C-reactive protein) were assessed over a 24-week follow-up.ResultsThe study included 40 patients, 70% females, mean age of 69.2 ± 7.6 years, and mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 3.37 ± 1.4. Most of the patients (85%) initiated the CDED in phase 1. At baseline, 60% were in clinical remission and 40% had active disease. Patients with active disease demonstrated a significant clinical (HBI) improvement at week 6 which was sustained throughout week 12 (p ConclusionThe CDED appears to be an effective dietary intervention for managing CD in older-adults, offering potential benefits both in treating active disease and maintaining clinical remission. This diet could serve as an alternative or adjunct approach to pharmacological therapies, particularly for patients with mild disease or those at risk of adverse effects from advanced treatments.",

The second achieved digestive remission under golimumab and successfully controlled oral lesions with intralesional corticosteroids.DiscussionA literature review (Pubmed, ScienceDirect; up to January 2025) identified 17 articles involving 75 patients. Oral lesions appeared independently (54 %), concomitantly with digestive disease (20 %), or preceded it (26 %). Therapeutic responses were variable, with limited efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids. Anti-IL12/23 antibodies showed promising results in isolated cases, while data on anti-IL-23 antibodies and JAK inhibitors remain lacking.ConclusionDue to the absence of standardized therapeutic protocols, a personalized, multidisciplinary approach is essential.

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the mouth to anus and has an estimated incidence of up to 20 cases per 100,000. It is a chronic remitting disease associated with significant morbidity and increasing incidence worldwide. While endoscopy and biopsy form the cornerstone of diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a pivotal role in assessing disease extent and treatment response. Luminal complications such as stenoses, strictures, and complications such as fistula and abscesses are accurately detected and characterised non-invasively with these modalities. The appropriate use of imaging in CD, therefore, facilitates identification and localisation of diseased bowel segments and detection of complications and associations such as sclerosing cholangitis and sacroiliitis. Due to undisputed value of cross-sectional imaging combined with the chronic remitting and relapsing nature of CD, patients often undergo large numbers of imaging studies throughout their lifetime for diagnostic and surveillance purposes. This includes plain radiography and CT scanning, both of which involve exposure to ionising radiation. While the diagnostic information obtained from imaging is crucial for appropriate patient management, over a lifetime, patients with CD may be cumulatively exposed to high levels of ionising radiation. Therefore, consideration of patient radiation safety is of great importance and should form part of the risk-benefit analysis preceding each imaging study in CD patients. Given the increasing incidence of Crohn's disease, and the development and optimisation of alternative imaging modalities in CD, which avoid radiation exposure, as well as the sustained advances in CT technology which facilitate radiation dose reduction, the preparation of this article is timely. This article aims to deliver an up-to-date overview of the role of imaging in Crohn's disease and how consideration of radiation safety and radiation dose optimisation impacts choice of imaging modality in CD.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionCrohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with a highly variable course and unpredictable treatment response. As the therapeutic landscape expands, there is a growing need for biomarkers that can support earlier diagnosis, risk-stratification, treatment selection, and that can inform monitoring or discontinuation strategies.Areas coveredThis review explores the current state of biomarker development and application in CD across multiple disease stages - from prediction and prognosis to therapeutic response and monitoring. It critically appraises the evidence for serologic, genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic markers, and highlights their potential roles, limitations, and barriers to clinical implementation.Expert opinionDespite major scientific advances, precision medicine in CD remains largely unrealized, hindered by a lack of validated and deployable biomarkers. The field must urgently pivot from discovery to implementation, embedding biomarkers into clinical trial design, validating multi-omic signatures across diverse subtypes, and overcoming real-world barriers of cost, standardization, and regulation. We can no longer accept navigating CD management blindfolded. Precision medicine should no longer be a distant aspiration. It should be the standard we hold ourselves to. The ceiling will only break when we stop accepting it.",

She was subsequently introduced to several biologic agents, including adalimumab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab: All failed to maintain long-term endoscopic and clinical remission. She was introduced to upadacitinib (UPA), but her disease worsened because of the so-called ghost pill phenomenon, by which pills are ejected directly into a pouch through the colostomy because of her short bowel after surgery, which prevented therapeutic efficacy. When using an extended-release agent such as UPA in patients with CD, the patient's gastrointestinal condition must be considered. Moreover, appropriate information must be shared with other health care professionals.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of reviewComplicated Crohn's disease in the small bowel is often associated with structural complications, particularly strictures. Endoscopy plays a key role in the diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapy of small bowel CD. This article will provide state-of-the-art endoscopic treatment modalities for small bowel complications in CD.Recent findingsEndoscopic therapy for small bowel disease can be delivered through upper endoscopy, push enteroscopy, ileocolonoscopy, device-assisted enteroscopy, intraoperative enteroscopy, and ileoscopy. In addition to persistent medical therapy, endoscopic treatment is performed using bare- or drug-coated balloon dilation, electrocision, and mechanical stricturectomy. Isolated ileocecal valve CD with associated stricture and adjacent fistulas comprises a unique phenotype of CD, mimicking the clinical presentation and disease course of achalasia at the gastroesophageal junction. Ileocecal valve CD can be treated with stricturectomy and fistulotomy. Endoscopy also has a major role in the treatment of surgery-associated anastomotic complications (such as stricture, bleeding, and leaks). Endoscopic treatment should be attempted in patients with short (<4-5) small bowel strictures on top of medical therapy. Isolated ileocecal valve CD represents a unique phenotype of CD consisting of inflammation, stricture, and fistula at and around the valve, which is amenable for endoscopic therapy.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundMutations in RELA, a key component of NF-κB signaling, are associated with dysregulated immune responses and inflammatory disorders. While immunodeficiency phenotypes associated with RELA haploinsufficiency have been reported, gastrointestinal manifestations remain poorly described. This study aimed to characterize the clinical, genomic, and immunological features of a patient presenting with an atypical Crohn's-like phenotype driven by RELA haploinsufficiency.MethodsWhole-exome sequencing was performed, and results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Protein modeling, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and nuclear extract-based NF-κB activation assays were conducted to assess the functional impact of the identified variant. Immune profiling was performed using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and compared to controls.ResultsWe studied a 17-year-old male diagnosed with pan-enteric Crohn's disease (CD), perianal fistulas, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and chronic lymphopenia. Sequencing identified a heterozygous missense variant in RELA (c.587T>C, p.V196A) that potentially impairs RelA (p65) protein stability, confirmed by reduced activity and diminished protein expression. CyTOF analysis revealed decreased circulating T regulatory cells (Tregs), absence of mucosal Tregs, high apoptotic rates, and elevated IFN-γ induced levels, while scRNA-seq demonstrated a robust type I/II interferon signature in multiple immune subsets. Dysregulated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and cytotoxic CD4+ T cells exhibited upregulation of IL23R and ADAM12, further linking RELA dysfunction to enhanced pro-inflammatory T cell response and tissue inflammation.ConclusionThis study links RELA haploinsufficiency with CD-like features, Th1/Th17 polarization, and interferon-driven inflammation, emphasizing the importance of genetic evaluation in patients with atypical or refractory IBD.",

      "abstract": "Introduction/backgroundCrohn's disease is a chronic autoimmune bowel disease that typically causes inflammation of the lining or wall of the small and large intestines as well as the entire gastrointestinal tract. Patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease can develop oral ulcers, which are also a symptom of vitamin C deficiency, also known as scurvy. Patients with Crohn's disease are prone to experiencing nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin C deficiency due to malabsorption.Case presentationIn this case report, we describe a very interesting presentation of scurvy in the presence of extensive oral Crohn's ulcers. The patient presented to the clinic reporting bleeding gums and painful mouth sores. An extensive workup revealed high inflammatory levels and low vitamin C levels. The patient received vitamin C infusions with improvement in symptoms. However, further workup, including a capsule endoscopy and oral biopsies, revealed Crohn's disease.ConclusionThere have been limited reports regarding the concurrence of both scurvy and Crohn's disease. With oral ulcerations being a characteristic of both conditions, diagnosing Crohn's disease in the setting of Vitamin C deficiency may be challenging.",

We studied the effects of autophagy modulation using Tat-beclin-1 and carbamazepine (CBZ) on dendritic cells (DCs) and Paneth cell functionality in pediatric CD patients. Twenty CD children genotyped for the ATG16L1 rs2241880 polymorphism and 10 healthy controls were enrolled. DCs were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated particles of Escherichia coli or DQ-ovalbumin after pretreatment with CBZ or Tat-beclin-1 to evaluate antigen processing. Treated DCs were stained for P62, LAMP1, and LC3, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Paneth cells from biopsies were pretreated with both drugs, stained for lysozyme, and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Antigen processing increased after Tat-beclin-1 and CBZ treatment in all groups. DCs expressed higher activation markers HLA-DR and CD86+, notably in high-risk patients, who also showed increased DQ-OVA processing. The number of lysozymes in Paneth cells from controls did not change after Tat-beclin-1 treatment, while in the CD group, it decreased significantly, suggesting increased exocytosis. CBZ treatment increased secretory granules only in CD inflamed tissue. Our results indicate that CBZ and Tat-beclin-1 enhance autophagic flux, representing a novel approach to treating pediatric CD patients.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundDiagnosing paediatric Crohn's disease (CD) based on histology can present challenges. We evaluate the histological spectrum of treatment-naïve biopsies from children with CD and assess these findings' diagnostic and predictive value.MethodsThree cohorts were identified: (1) 137 patients with CD, (2) 116 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and (3) 50 patients without inflammatory bowel disease. Biopsies from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were re-examined for signs of active and chronic inflammation, including lymphocyte-pattern oesophagitis, focal enhancing gastritis and indicators of chronicity. Additionally, granulomas and microgranulomas (defined as clusters of 4-9 epithelioid histiocytes) were evaluated.ResultsLymphocyte-pattern oesophagitis was observed in 15% of patients (n=20). Moderate-to-severe diffuse gastritis was noted in 50.4% of patients (n=68), while focal enhancing gastritis was identified in 11.1% (n=15). In terminal ileal biopsies, 46.1% exhibited activity and 5.3% showed features of chronicity. Active colitis was present in 73% of patients (n=100), with chronic colitis seen in 11.7% (n=16). Granulomas and microgranulomas were observed in 31.4% (43/137) and 48.9% (67/137) of patients, respectively. Notably, 30.7% (42/137) of patients with microgranulomas were without granulomas. Previously undetected microgranulomas were found in 20 of 27 cases. 2.5% of patients with UC and none of the control cohort showed microgranulomas. Lymphocyte-pattern oesophagitis was associated with an increased need for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy (p=0.007).ConclusionsGI microgranulomas, often overlooked, are specific to CD in the proper clinical context. Oesophageal lymphocytosis may predict a need for more aggressive treatment. The study brings to light under-recognised aspects of CD's histological diagnosis, including the oversight of microgranulomas, the high prevalence of diffuse gastritis and low prevalence of focal enhancing gastritis, the frequent absence of terminal ileitis and the infrequent occurrence of chronic colitis.",

Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an idiopathic, chronic, granulomatous inflammatory panarteritis that involves the aorta and its branches, known as \"pulseless disease.\" Crohn's disease and TA are both associated, as both are granulomatous disorders, and multiple cases of simultaneous occurrence of both diseases have been reported. Here we are reporting a rare case of simultaneous CD and TA in a young female who had a large enteroenteric fistula between the colon and jejunum and total occlusion of both subclavian arteries with reformed collaterals.

Gene expression and genetics of the neoterminal ileum at postoperative, surveillance colonoscopies highlight pathways of disease recurrence. Postoperative colonoscopy transcriptomes were interrogated to evaluate the hypothesis that specific molecular mechanisms contribute to recurrent Crohn's pathophysiology.MethodsRibo-depleted, paired-end sequencing was run on 339 neoterminal ileal pinch biopsies from 267 patients with (Rutgeerts i2b+) and without (Rutgeerts i2a or lower) recurrent disease. Differential gene and transcript usage were assessed. Expression quantitative trait loci link genetic variation with gene expression. Serial sampling was performed on 70 patients.ResultsAt colonoscopy, 4171 genes increased and 3579 genes decreased in recurring vs nonrecurring patients. Although gene expression was highly correlated (r = 0.71), we observed and replicated higher dynamic ranges of gene expression in male compared with female patients. Activation of both pro- (tumor necrosis factor, interferon gamma) and anti-inflammatory (transforming growth factor beta) pathways was observed; importantly, multiple nuclear hormone receptor pathways demonstrated activation, including both estrogen and dihydrotestosterone pathways, whereas progesterone was inhibited. We observed sex-specific expression quantitative trait loci driven by recurrent samples and differential transcript usage related to lipid metabolism, membrane trafficking, and the extracellular matrix.ConclusionsIn recurrent disease of the postoperative neoterminal ileum, markedly greater dynamic ranges of gene expression occur in male compared with female patients. Pathway analyses implicate numerous nuclear hormone pathways, highlighting new mechanisms for therapeutic targeting beyond pro-inflammatory cytokine blockade. This study identifies key covariates and pathways of disease recurrence, many of which are distinct from drivers of initial disease susceptibility.",

We investigated whether sarcopenia at the diagnosis impacts the outcomes of children with CD.MethodsThis was a retrospective, single-center, case-control study of newly diagnosed children with CD undergoing magnetic resonance (MR) within 1 month from the diagnosis, from 2011 to 2022. Sarcopenia was assessed by measuring total psoas muscle area (tPMA) at L3-L4 level on the MR and defined as z-score values ≤2 SDs. Children with and without sarcopenia were compared for the risk of disease flares, CD-related hospitalization, complications, need for step-up treatment, and courses of steroids over a 2-year follow-up.ResultsSeventy-eight children were included (median age 10.7 years), 46 (59%) with sarcopenia and 32 (41%) without. The risk of clinical relapse was higher in patients with sarcopenia at 6 [19.5% vs 3%, odds ratio (OR) 7.5 (95% CI, 1.5-85)] and 12 months [30% vs 6%, OR 6.5 (95% CI, 1.4-30.4)]. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed lower survival free from relapses in children with sarcopenia (log rank P = .01, hazard ratio 2.7, 95% CI, 1.4-4.5). Multivariate analysis identified sarcopenia as independent predictors of clinical relapses (OR 1.7, 95% CI, 1-3.1, P = .045). No other independent predictor of unfavorable outcome was detected.ConclusionsThe presence of sarcopenia at the diagnosis increases the risk of clinical relapses in the first year of diagnosis. Magnetic resonance evaluation of the tPMA could therefore help identify children at higher risk of worse outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in the monitoring of Crohn's disease (CD), offering a non-invasive, real-time assessment of transmural inflammation. Unlike conventional endpoints based on clinical scores, biomarkers, or mucosal evaluation, IUS allows direct visualization of bowel wall changes, enabling earlier detection of treatment response and more accurate prognostic assessment. IUS has demonstrated good diagnostic performance for the detection of strictures, penetrating complications, and postoperative recurrence. The development of advanced modalities such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and elastography has further expanded its potential, particularly in differentiating inflammatory from fibrotic lesions-an emerging clinical need in the context of anti-fibrotic therapies. Evidence suggests that IUS findings can influence therapeutic decisions in routine practice, supporting treatment escalation, de-escalation, or switching in a timely and objective manner. Special applications, including transperineal ultrasound and use during pregnancy, reinforce the versatility and safety of IUS in challenging clinical scenarios. While technical limitations persist in certain patient subgroups, IUS remains a repeatable, accessible, and well-tolerated imaging modality that complements other diagnostic tools. As artificial intelligence enhances image interpretation and quantitative analysis, IUS is poised to become a cornerstone of precision medicine in CD. Its capacity to guide timely, individualized decisions makes it an essential component of modern disease monitoring and treatment optimization strategies.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, presents significant challenges in clinical medicine due to its multifactorial etiology and varied therapeutic responses. This review examines the diverse causes of CD, including genetic predispositions identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which involve scanning the genome for single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CD risk, as well as environmental triggers, such as diet and alterations in the microbiome. Biomarkers, such as fecal calprotectin and Creactive protein (CRP), as well as genetic markers like NOD2 mutations, provide critical tools for diagnosis and treatment stratification. Advances in computational methodologies, including multiomics analyses and machine learning, have enhanced our understanding of CD pathophysiology and therapeutic outcomes. Traditional treatments, including immunomodulators and biologics, such as anti-TNF agents, have laid the groundwork for novel cytokine-targeted therapies, such as IL-12/23 inhibitors (e.g., ustekinumab) and integrin inhibitors (e.g., vedolizumab), which aim to improve mucosal healing and reduce relapse rates. However, integrating personalized medicine into clinical practice remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of CD and limitations in biomarker validation. The integration of predictive biomarkers with computational tools enables clinicians to tailor therapy at the individual level, improving remission rates, minimizing adverse effects, and enhancing long-term disease control. These personalized strategies show promise in shifting CD management toward a more effective, patient-specific model of care. This review underscores the potential of personalized therapeutic strategies, leveraging molecular and computational insights, to optimize disease management and improve patient outcomes in CD.",

Overcoming resistance remains a significant clinical challenge, largely due to the incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. This study explores the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the development of resistance to anti-TNFα therapy.MethodsUsing public single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets, combined with in vitro primary cell experiments and multiplex immunofluorescence validation, we investigated key factors contributing to therapy failure.ResultsTranscriptomic analysis revealed that ECM-related pathways were enriched in Crohn's disease patients and associated with resistance to anti-TNFα therapy. Single-cell analysis identified Fibroblast 2 (CD81+ fibroblasts) as the major ECM-related stromal subpopulation, exhibiting the highest capacity for ECM secretion and degradation. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) was identified as a key protease highly expressed in this subset, showing close interaction with macrophages. Co-culture of primary fibroblasts and macrophages led to increased release of inflammatory mediators such as TNFα and IL-6, which was partially reduced by MMP2 inhibition, suggesting a potential regulatory role of MMP2 in fibroblast-macrophage crosstalk. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunofluorescence further supported the spatial colocalization and interaction of fibroblasts, macrophages, and MMP2 within the tissue microenvironment.ConclusionsThis study highlights the association of pathogenic fibroblasts and ECM remodeling in anti-TNFα therapy failure, identifies MMP2 as a potential target, and suggests that combination therapy may offer a potential strategy for patients with treatment resistance.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is an idiopathic, chronic, and recurrent inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in CD, particularly dysbiosis-an imbalance in gut bacteria. While dysbiosis is consistently observed in CD, it remains uncertain whether it is a cause or a consequence of the disease. Given its association with CD, the therapeutic potential of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been explored. This review examines the role of gut microbiota in CD, evaluates the therapeutic potential of probiotics and FMT, and highlights current research findings and limitations. Key studies on the relationship between gut dysbiosis, probiotics, and FMT in CD were analyzed, with a focus on randomized trials, meta-analyses, and clinical observations. Dysbiosis is a consistent feature of CD, but its causative role remains unclear. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have shown no efficacy in inducing or maintaining remission in CD. FMT shows potential as a therapeutic option for CD, but its efficacy remains inconsistent and inconclusive. The variability in outcomes, including diminished effects over time despite repeated FMT, underscores the need for larger, well-controlled trials. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) has compared FMT with sham transplantation, but the sample size was very small. Other studies are limited by factors such as small sample sizes, lack of control groups, short follow-up periods, and inconsistent methodologies, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. While gut dysbiosis likely plays a role in CD pathogenesis, its causative role remains uncertain. Current evidence does not support FMT as a reliable treatment for inducing or maintaining remission in CD, though it appears generally safe. Larger, standardized, RCTs are necessary to clarify the therapeutic role of FMT in CD management.",

A major limitation accepting this view is that irrefutable evidence that MAP causes Crohn's disease-the demonstration that long-term remission follows clearance of the infection with antibiotics-has been lacking. While several centers continue to advocate their use, most authoritative guidelines do not recommend anti-MAP regimens. This viewpoint aims to evaluate current data, in particular, the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-MAP therapy published in 2007 and in 2024. We conclude that, similar to several other antibiotic regimens, the benefit of anti-MAP therapy in active Crohn's Disease (CD) is likely to be modest. Continuing treatment is unlikely to be of benefit if there is no significant objective improvement in disease activity by 16 weeks. Any beneficial effect of anti-MAP therapy is not maintained after its discontinuation.

Data were integrated with a public dataset and a Luminex-based serum assay to identify fibrosis-related interleukins, which were further validated at mRNA and protein levels. Correlations with clinical indicators and surgical outcome were analyzed. Lastly, an in vitro assay was used to evaluate the pro-fibrotic effect of the candidate interleukin.ResultsBulk RNA-sequencing and public dataset revealed increased expression of IL11 in the fibrostenotic intestinal segments of CD patients, which was further validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The serum Luminex assay showed that serum IL11 is significantly increased in stricturing CD patients compared to that in non-stricturing CD patients. Clinically, serum IL11 was correlated with disease behavior (r = 0.343, p = 0.006), and increased IL11 expression was linked to a higher risk of subsequent surgery (log-rank p = 0.0055). Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that IL11 and its receptor IL11RA were mainly expressed by fibroblasts.

      "abstract": "Background and study aimsNoninvasive biomarkers are needed to monitor disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, as current methods-including blood tests, endoscopy, imaging, and fecal calprotectin-are invasive, costly, or burdensome. This study explored salivary calprotectin as a potential biomarker for Crohn's disease activity.Patients and methodsThis was a cross-sectional exploratory study. Unstimulated saliva was collected from patients with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease and matched healthy controls. Disease activity was determined via the Crohn's disease Activity Index. Salivary calprotectin was measured in 20 μl saliva samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.ResultsSamples were collected from 42 patients with Crohn's disease (mean age 36.3 ± 14.2 years, 52.4 % male) and 41 age-matched healthy controls (mean age 38 ± 13.4 years, 58.5 % male). For patients with Crohn's disease, the median salivary calprotectin level was 0.08 (IQR 0.05-0.14) ug/ml compared to 0.06 (IQR 0.03-0.13) ug/ml in healthy controls (p = 0.161). Among patients with Crohn's disease, levels were similar in remission (0.10, IQR 0.05-0.15 μg/mL) and active disease (0.07, IQR 0.03-0.10 μg/mL; p = 0.091). No correlation was observed between salivary calprotectin and Crohn's disease activity index scores (Spearman's r = -0.136, p = 0.392).ConclusionsSalivary calprotectin did not distinguish patients with Crohn's disease from healthy controls or correlate with disease activity. While noninvasive, it does not appear to be a clinically useful biomarker for monitoring Crohn's disease.

ISPs exhibit gene expression profiles consistent with normal secretory progenitor cells but concomitantly express a suite of distinguishing pro-inflammatory genes. Mechanistically, ISPs exhibit open chromatin at ISP gene loci. Although ISP-specific genes are not expressed in intestinal stem cells, their chromatin is accessible in Crohn's disease stem cells, suggesting that ISP genes are epigenetically poised in stem cells and subsequently transcriptionally activated in ISPs in the presence of inflammatory stimuli. Consistently, Crohn's disease colonoids exhibit sustained ISP gene expression that can be elicited further with pro-inflammatory cytokines or via co-culture with pro-inflammatory macrophages.ConclusionsWe have defined differences in the epithelial stem and progenitor compartment of patients with Crohn's disease that suggest aberrant stem cell differentiation and inflammatory gene expression arise and persist during disease.",

Its rare involvement of the appendix can mimic acute appendicitis, often leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate initial management.Case presentationWe report three patients who presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and were initially diagnosed and surgically treated for acute appendicitis. However, all were subsequently found to have ileocecal CD. Each case involved complications such as fistula formation or persistent symptoms, ultimately requiring further surgical intervention and appropriate medical therapy with immunosuppressants and biologics.Clinical discussionThese cases highlight the diagnostic challenge posed by CD when it presents with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis. A history of chronic or recurrent abdominal symptoms, postoperative complications, or atypical findings should raise suspicion for underlying IBD. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary surgeries and reduce morbidity.ConclusionMisdiagnosis of Crohn's disease as appendicitis led to complications and delayed care. Crohn's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with atypical or recurrent right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Early use of fecal calprotectin and imaging can aid diagnosis and improve outcomes in patients with atypical presentations.",

Postoperative recurrence is common, especially at the anastomosis, with varying recurrence rates.ObjectiveIdentifying risk factors for recurrence is crucial for optimizing treatment. This study aims to assess traditional and novel risk factors, including histological factors, for recurrence in patients undergoing ileocolic resection in a deeply phenotyped regional cohort.DesignA retrospective, multicenter cohort study.SettingsTwo large referral medical centers in South-Limburg, The Netherlands, with access to integrated electronic health records and scanned historical records. Data on demographics, Crohn's disease characteristics and peri-operative findings were collected, and factors influencing recurrence were analyzed.PatientsA total of 289 consecutive patients ≥16 years old undergoing ileocolic resection between January 2003 and December 2017 with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's Disease according to European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation criteria. Patients were followed for a mean of 7.02 years.InterventionNo experimental interventions were administered. Surgical treatment consisted of standard ileocolic resection performed either open or laparoscopically.Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was postoperative recurrence, defined as clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, or surgical recurrence. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors.ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 7.02 years, 189 (65.4%) developed recurrence. Multivariable analysis identified smoking, and pathologic margin involvement as significant risk factors for clinical recurrence. Montreal or B3 classification, and open surgery were protective. Surgical recurrence was lower in patients undergoing open surgery.LimitationsThe retrospective design may introduce selection and information bias. Surveillance and prophylactic therapy were not standardized.ConclusionsThis study reinforces the role of smoking, disease behavior, resection margin involvement, and perianal disease as key risk factors for recurrence following ileocolic resection. Harmonizing definitions, data collection, and treatment protocols through international collaboration is essential for advancing clinical management and facilitating large-scale prospective studies.

Upper gastrointestinal involvement (UGI) in Crohn's disease is present in up to 15% of patients and can present as a diagnostic challenge given nonspecific symptoms and overlapping disease entities. This review provides an update on diagnosing and risk stratifying UGI-CD.Recent findingsLiterature suggests the use of imaging modalities (such as video capsule endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging and intestinal ultrasound) to help identify proximal inflammation when clinical suspicion for UGI involvement exists based on symptoms and patient factors. Additionally, proximal disease involvement has been associated with increased disease severity, a higher prevalence of strictures and an increased risk for surgery. First-line therapies are corticosteroids and antitumor necrosis factor therapies if systemic treatment is needed based on disease severity. For stricturing disease, endoscopic balloon dilation, strictureplasty, surgical resection or bypass can be considered for medically refractory or recurrent disease.SummaryAs the prevalence and progression of UGI-CD is still understudied due to its variable definition, presentation and incidence, the development of a standardized approach to diagnosis could aid in determining the overall prevalence and most effective treatments.",

Projections estimate that by 2030, one-third of patients with IBD will be older adults. Managing older adults with IBD poses unique challenges, including frailty, multimorbidity and polypharmacy. This review summarises the approach to managing older adults with small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD), a distinct IBD sub-type.Recent findingsThe 2024 \"State of IBD care in the United Kingdom (UK)\" report revealed a median delay of 8 months from onset of Crohn's disease symptoms to diagnosis. Diagnostic delay in Crohn's disease is associated with stricturing and penetrating complications. Diagnostic challenges in SBCD include its insidious presentation in older adults and the poor utility of calprotectin as a biomarker, with a positive predictive value of only 23.1% with a calprotectin over 200 μg/g. Management should be tailored to patient preference and frailty, given the paucity of evidence pertaining to nutritional, medical and surgical treatment approaches in older adults.SummaryOlder adults with IBD represent a heterogenous cohort.

This systematic review aims to unravel the intricate relationship between CD and bile acids (BA), exploring variations and inconsistencies in BA composition related to disease activity, anatomical localization, and surgical history.MethodsStudies reporting BA in CD from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, and WOS have been collected. Data extraction encompassed various study characteristics, population demographics, and BA measurements in serum, intestinal, and fecal compartments. Quality assessment was performed using appropriate tools for different study designs.ResultsTwenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 656 patients with CD and 339 healthy controls. Secondary BA-deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid (LCA)-were consistently reduced in patients with CD, particularly in active disease and following ileal resection. Total serum BA levels showed no significant differences between CD and controls, though conjugated primary BA (cholic acid [CA] and chenodeoxycholic acid [CDCA]) were variably decreased postprandially. Intestinal BA pool size was reduced in ileal and ileocolonic CD, while fecal BA excretion was elevated, especially in patients with ileal resection. Gallbladder bile in CD demonstrated reduced secondary BA fractions and undetectable LCA.ConclusionCrohn's disease is associated with significant disturbances in BA metabolism, particularly a reduction in secondary BA and increased fecal excretion, which were mainly due to ileal dysfunction, microbial dysbiosis, and accelerated transit.

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease is a transmural inflammatory bowel disease, which can progress to stricturing and internal penetrating complications. Computed tomography enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) are utilized with endoscopy to detect and stage small bowel Crohn's disease. Small bowel strictures and associated penetrating complications are commonly missed complications of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease at CTE/MRE. This educational review focuses on factors contributing to unreported or overcalled strictures including disease location, postoperative anatomy, erroneous understanding of threshold dilation for stricture diagnosis, and underappreciation for how stricture diagnosis can improve patient care, emphasizing current understanding of Crohn's small bowel strictures using illustrative cases. In addition, we explain emerging consensus for how strictures and their associated obstruction can be consistently measured and described. We also review frequently missed complications of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease such as chronic mesenteric venous occlusion and penetrating complications, including blind-ending sinus tracts, and ileoappendiceal and complex enteroenteric fistulas. Finally, common mimics of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease including NSAID enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and other entities are discussed, highlighting key distinguishing imaging and clinical features. Radiologists must be proactive in identifying strictures to improve patient outcomes and prevent unnecessary delay in surgical intervention or access to targeted biologic therapies.",

ECM drives the significant clinical problem of intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients that require surgical intervention in a large group of the population.Areas coveredIn this review, we delineate the role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a matrix bound, calcium (Ca) dependent enzyme, as an important effector in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. We discuss the role of TG2 in fibrotic diseases with a focus on intestinal fibrosis and TG2 as a potential target for therapy of stricturing CD. This review additionally covers the progress in our mechanistic understanding of TG2 as a marker and driver for intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation in IBD patients.Expert opinionTG2 may play a central role in promoting inflammation independent progression of fibrosis, potentially explaining the lack of efficacy of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs in fibrotic diseases. The anti-fibrotic potential of TG2 specific inhibitors in stricturing Crohn's disease are just starting to be explored. Further investigations are needed to identify novel mechanisms for TG2 specific inhibitors in the intestine.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundIntra-abdominal abscess (IAA) is a serious complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Management strategies include medical therapy, percutaneous drainage (PD), and initial surgery, but the optimal approach is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these strategies.MethodsA systematic search of 4 electronic databases was conducted. The primary outcome was the need for surgical intervention (resection or reoperation). Secondary outcomes included recurrence and complications. Data were pooled using random-effects models.ResultsTwenty-three studies were included. Compared with initial surgery, both PD (odds ratio [OR], 5.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-16.91) and medical management (antibiotics alone ± corticosteroids) (OR, 4.40; 95% CI, 1.25-15.45) were associated with significantly higher odds of requiring surgical intervention, relative to the reoperation rate in the surgery group. PD was associated with significantly lower odds of overall postintervention complications compared with initial surgery (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.96), with no significant difference in length of stay. Adjunctive exclusive enteral nutrition was associated with a significant reduction in the need for subsequent surgery (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.67). Pooled proportions for requiring subsequent surgery were 48% for medical management, 47% for PD, and 21% for the reoperation rate in the initial surgical group.ConclusionInitial surgical management is the most definitive treatment for CD-related IAA, with the lowest reoperation rates. PD serves as a less invasive bridge to surgery that reduces postintervention complications. Medical management alone is less effective and should be reserved for select patients.",

The patency capsule was developed to detect small bowel strictures. The usefulness of patency capsules in patients who do not have evidence of small bowel disease on imaging is uncertain.StudyThis is a multicenter retrospective study of patients with suspected or confirmed CD who underwent a patency capsule study between January 2017 and February 2023. We excluded patients who were lost to follow-up or did not have computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen within 180 days before or after the patency capsule study.ResultsA total of 105 patients met the inclusion criteria with 69% having a confirmed CD diagnosis. The majority of patients (95/105; 90.5%) passed their patency capsule. A total of 91 patients had their subsequent video capsule endoscopy (VCE), with 96.7% (88/91) successfully passing the capsule. Out of those who passed the VCE, 2 patients had patency capsule retention. Both had normal small bowel imaging. Meanwhile, the 3 patients who had VCE retention had evidence of small bowel disease in their imaging scans. The presence of abnormal small bowel wall thickening or stricture on imaging had a statistically significant association with VCE retention ( P =0.02).ConclusionOur study demonstrated a statistically significant association between small bowel disease on imaging and retention of both patency capsules and VCE. Small bowel imaging in patients with suspected or documented CD had a negative predictive value of 100% for VCE retention.",

However, conventional MIPD often requires manual simulation and regimen selection, which are time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Reinforcement learning (RL), in which an agent learns optimal decisions through iterative interactions with an environment, offers a scalable and automated alternative. In this study, we developed a model-informed Deep Q-Network (DQN) to personalize infliximab dosing for patients with Crohn's disease. The DQN was trained in a simulation environment incorporating a population PK model, inter-individual variability, and assay error. Virtual patients with randomly and independently sampled covariates from log-normal distributions were used to explore dosing strategies at Infusions 1, 3, and 4. Doses ranged from 1 to 10 mg/kg at Infusion 1 and from 1 to 20 mg/kg thereafter, with intervals of 4-12 weeks. The reward function prioritized achieving trough concentrations of 18-26 μg/mL before Infusion 3 and 5-10 μg/mL before Infusions 4 and 5, while penalizing overtreatment and additional infusions. The DQN policy converged after 80,000 episodes, yielding target attainment probabilities (PTAs) of 92.9% and 98.4% at Infusions 4 and 5, respectively, in 1000 virtual patients. High doses (11-20 mg/kg) were selected in only 0.2% of cases. At Infusion 4, 66.8% of patients received an 8-week interval, and 57.3% at Infusion 5. Retrospective real-world validation showed that patients whose actual doses matched DQN recommendations had trough levels significantly closer to target ranges. These findings support the feasibility of using DQN-based agents to enhance and automate infliximab individualized dosing in pediatric populations.",

This study aimed to identify shared molecular markers and functional pathways underlying both diseases and explore their correlations with immune infiltration.MethodsWe analyzed microarray datasets (GSE30999, GSE186582) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct co-expression modules, followed by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Hub genes were selected via support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and validated in independent datasets (GSE14905, GSE112366). Immune infiltration was evaluated by CIBERSORT.ResultsWe identified 1540 DEGs in CD and 1157 in psoriasis, with 234 overlapping DEGs enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway (KEGG) and, critically, in secretory granule/cytoplasmic vesicular lumen (GO-CC); these cellular compartments are essential for the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines downstream of IL-17 signaling. SVM-RFE identified three hub genes (CLDN8, APOL1, TCN1) validated in independent datasets. In CD, APOL1/TCN1 correlated positively with Neutrophils and inversely with M2 Macrophages, while CLDN8 showed the opposite. In psoriasis, APOL1/TCN1 correlated positively with Activated CD4 Memory T cells and inversely with Resting Mast cells, whereas CLDN8 displayed the opposite.ConclusionThis study elucidated the shared expression markers and functional pathways between CD and psoriasis. These findings offer new clues for comorbid mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, needing further validation. Key points • The study uncovers shared gene signatures and functional pathways between CD and psoriasis. • Three hub genes (CLDN8, APOL1, TCN1) and IL-17 signaling pathway were validated as potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for both CD and psoriasis through integrative bioinformatics.",

However, most of the data derive from randomized controlled trials or small retrospective studies with short- or mid-term follow-up. This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of risankizumab in a real-world cohort of patients with CD.MethodsThis single-center, retrospective, cohort study included consecutive patients with CD treated with risankizumab from October 2022 to August 2024. A time-to-event analysis was performed for treatment failure, treatment escalation, and CD-related health care utilization. Treatment failure was defined as the need for drug discontinuation due to primary nonresponse, loss of response, or a serious adverse event or the need for IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)-related surgery. Treatment escalation was defined as the need for shortening the dose interval or intravenous reinduction due to breakthrough CD-related symptoms and/or elevated biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. Health care utilization was defined as CD-related emergency department visit or hospitalization. Patients were followed from start of risankizumab until drug discontinuation or the end of follow-up (October 2024).ResultsThe study population consisted of 106 patients with CD (74% receiving prior biological therapies). Patients were followed for a median of 12 [interquartile range (IQR), 6.8-18.8] months; 14 (13%) patients had treatment failure; 24 (23%) had treatment escalation; and 17 (16%) had CD-related health care utilization. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified penetrating CD as associated with treatment failure [hazard ratio (HR), 5.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-17.2; P = .007], while perianal fistulizing CD (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.4; P = .023) and prior exposure to more than 2 biologics (HR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.3-26.3; P = .022) were associated with treatment escalation.ConclusionIn this real-world cohort with long-term follow-up, risankizumab was generally effective in patients with CD.

Its pathophysiology involves dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, which can occur in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) individuals. Therefore, we hypothesize that CHIP may influence CD incidence. However, no study has explored the association between CHIP and incident CD. We analyzed UK Biobank data to investigate the association between CHIP and incident CD.MethodsCHIP was defined based on whole-exome sequencing data. The outcome was incident CD. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CD in relation to CHIP.ResultsThis study included 461 913 participants, of whom 14 339 (3.1%) had CHIP. The incidence rate of CD was 21.6 and 37.7 per 100 000 person-years for individuals without and with CHIP, respectively. We found a statistically significant increased risk of CD among individuals with CHIP (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.30-2.16), compared with the reference group. This association was particularly stronger in individuals with JAK2-mutant CHIP (HR, 7.28; 95% CI, 1.82-29.13), ASXL1-mutant CHIP (HR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.74-5.44), and DNMT3A-mutant CHIP (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.24-2.42). Additionally, the association did not vary greatly by demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle factors, CHIP clone size, or cancer comorbidity.ConclusionsCHIP was associated with a markedly increased risk of subsequent CD. The association was particularly stronger in JAK2-mutant CHIP, ASXL1-mutant CHIP, and DNMT3A-mutant CHIP. The findings of this study may offer potential insights for future investigations into the mechanistic underpinnings of CD.",

We present a case of a 21-year-old male with ileocolonic CD, post-resection, who was admitted with repeated gross hematuria. Initial imaging (CT/MRI) revealed bladder wall thickening and an enterocolonic fistula, but no enterovesical communication. Cystoscopy revealed widespread mucosal erythema and ulceration, and histopathology was in keeping with chronic inflammation but not malignancy or granulomas. Multidisciplinary evaluation excluded malignancies and infections and led to a diagnosis of non-fistulous bladder ulceration associated with CD. Escalation of infliximab led to the resolution of hematuria and sustained remission at six-month follow-up. This case highlights the importance of recognition of atypical bladder involvement in CD patients with urinary symptoms, even in the absence of fistulas. Advanced imaging techniques, cystoscopy, and multidisciplinary cooperation are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, particularly dose-intensified regimens, can effectively manage both intestinal and extraintestinal inflammation, suggesting the participation of shared immunopathogenic mechanisms.

Complications of the J-pouch include pouchitis, occurring in 50%-80% of patients, and Crohn's disease (CD) of the pouch, occurring in 3%-17%. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab (UST) and vedolizumab (VDZ) in patients with CD of the pouch.MethodsThis was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of adults with CD of the pouch treated with UST or VDZ. The primary outcome was clinical response at 3 or 6 months. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response, histologic response, pouch failure or surgery, and adverse effects of therapy.

Clinical remission occurred in 32% UST-treated patients and 18% VDZ-treated patients at 3 months and 29% and 21% at 6 months, respectively. Among those treated with UST, 41% achieved endoscopic response, 10% achieved endoscopic remission, 46% achieved histologic response, and 7% achieved histologic remission. Among those treated with VDZ, 27% achieved endoscopic response, 16% achieved endoscopic remission, 26% achieved histologic response, and 8% achieved histologic remission. Over a follow-up period of 3 years, 5% UST-treated patients had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related hospitalization, and 9% required pouch-failure surgery. In total, 3% VDZ-treated patients had IBD-related hospitalization and 5% required pouch-failure surgery. Reported adverse effects were uncommon, including arthralgias (1), hair loss (1), syncope (1), and upper respiratory infection (1) for UST and wrist edema (1) and elevated transaminases (1) for VDZ. In multivariable analyses, patients on UST were more likely to have a clinical response compared to VDZ at 3 months (OR 2.73, 95% [CI] 1.13-6.56, P = .025) and 6 months (OR 2.53, 95% CI: 1.01-6.29, P = .046).

This multicenter study aimed to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics, surgical management, and outcomes of patients with CD who underwent surgery for SBNENs.MethodsA multicenter, retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with a history of CD who underwent surgical resection for an SBNEN between September 1992 and March 2025. Data on patient and tumor characteristics, surgical details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. Time-to-event analysis was used to determine the recurrence and survival rates.ResultsThe study included 22 patients (63.4% male) with a median age of 49 years at CD diagnosis. An interval of 108 months was noted between CD diagnosis and SBNEN detection. SBNENs were often an incidental finding during surgery (36.4%). Most tumors were in the ileum (72.7%), were grade 2 (72.7%), and presented with nodal metastases (59.1%). Complete surgical resection (R0) was achieved in 90.9% of cases, primarily through an open approach (68.2%). The postoperative morbidity rate was 50%. No local recurrences occurred over a median follow-up of 120 months, but distant recurrence (liver metastases) was observed in 13.6% of patients, with a cancer-related mortality rate of 9.1%.ConclusionSurgical resection for SBNENs in patients with CD provides excellent long-term oncologic control, although it is associated with considerable perioperative morbidity. The diagnosis is often delayed or incidental, underscoring the need for increased clinical suspicion and potentially enhanced surveillance strategies in this high-risk population.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundThe global incidence rate of Crohn's disease (CD) is rising, with mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) playing a pivotal role in CD progression, particularly in fibrosis development. This study aimed to identify key genes in MAT that contribute to CD progression, thereby providing insights for potential therapeutic strategies.MethodsThe CD-related datasets from the GEO database were aggregated to analyze differentially expressed secreted protein genes. Colon tissue and MAT were harvested from CD subjects and healthy subjects, and H&E and Masson staining were used to detect pathological changes. The expression level of the target gene was determined using various methods (including qRT-PCR, IHC, IF, and Western blot). Primary mesenteric adipocytes of CD patients and healthy controls were isolated and cultured, and epiregulin (EREG) expression was intervened to explore its effects on inflammatory cytokine secretion and lipid metabolism. Additionally, an in-vitro co-culture system of primary adipocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and an in-vivo 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced CD rat model were constructed to explore the effect of EREG on CD symptoms and the underlying mechanisms.ResultsEREG was highly expressed in both CD colon tissues and MAT. Overexpression of EREG in adipocytes facilitated the production of inflammatory factors and lipid metabolism, as well as promoted inflammation and fibrosis in co-cultured IECs. In vivo, EREG knockdown effectively alleviated CD symptoms and fibrosis in TNBS-induced CD rats. The underlying mechanism may be mediated by EREG, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the PPARγ signaling pathways in IECs. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A induced EREG expression in adipocytes from CD patients CONCLUSION: The abnormal upregulation of EREG in adipocytes within MAT contributes to the pathogenesis of CD by promoting inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting EREG may offer a novel therapeutic approach for the clinical treatment of CD.",

Here, we apply multiplexed imaging mass cytometry to spatially profile Peyer's patches and lymphoid follicles in biopsies from healthy controls and Crohn's disease patients with ileitis, isolated colonic involvement, or in remission. Despite tissue heterogeneity, our optimized preprocessing pipeline enabled robust tissue annotation, single-cell phenotyping, and neighbourhood-level analysis. While conventional analysis based on cell frequencies did not distinguish disease states, spatial analysis revealed disease-associated remodelling of lymphoid architecture. Biopsies from colonic Crohn's disease patients showed, within follicles, increased frequencies of activated CD8⁺ T cells and a reduction in naïve T cells, alongside enrichment of B cell-T cell interaction neighbourhoods. These alterations were most pronounced in smaller B-cell patches, suggesting more functionally dynamic immune-cell interactions in compact lymphoid structures. In contrast, Crohn's disease ileitis samples closely resembled healthy tissue, with minimal structural or immune cell perturbations. Our data support a model in which Peyer's patches and lymphoid follicles undergo structural and functional remodelling in response to colonic inflammation. These findings underscore the value of spatially resolved immune profiling to uncover tissue-specific immune dynamics in inflammatory bowel disease.",

Laparoscopic ileocecectomy is the procedure of choice and we use a single-incision laparoscopic technique (SILS). We have previously reported our experience with SILS ileocecectomy with a sizeable cohort compared to other series. This project aims to expand on our single-institutional experience and evaluate the impact of operative experience. Methods: We completed a single-institution retrospective review of patients who underwent SILS ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease from January 1, 2009 to March 31, 2024. Operative and inpatient characteristics were collected to determine complication rates. Subgroup analysis was completed comparing previously studied patients (January 1, 2009 to February 1, 2013) to our updated cohort. Results: Seventy-eight patients underwent SILS ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease and had a median age of 16.5 years (interquartile range: 15.0, 17.8). The median length of stay (LOS) was 96 hours (72, 186). The overall complication rate was 17%. On subgroup analysis, patients operated on after 2013 were older (P = .012), had a longer disease length before operating room (OR) (P = .051) and were more likely to be on anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (P = .014). Mean operative time was significantly lower in the newer cohort (70 mins versus 85 mins, P = .007). The patients in the newer cohort had a shorter median LOS (72 hours compared to 108 hours, P = .149) and had a lower complication (13% versus 23%, P = .283) and re-operation rate (4% versus 15%, P = .159). Conclusions: SILS ileocecectomy is effective and safe in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. As operative experience increases, we have observed a clinically significant decrease in operative time and complication rates. Level of Evidence: III, Retrospective study.",

Although the bacterial microbiome's role in CD pathogenesis has been extensively characterized, the fungal microbiota's contribution to fibrotic progression remains poorly defined. Growing evidence suggests fungi may influence fibrosis through immune and metabolic pathways. This study systematically evaluated compositional and functional alterations in the gut mycobiota associated with CD-related intestinal fibrosis. Method Fecal samples from well-characterized CD patients with (n = 22) and without (n = 19) intestinal fibrosis underwent ITS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina MiSeq platform, V4 region). Bioinformatics analysis included: (1) α-diversity assessment; (2) β-diversity evaluation via unweighted UniFrac distances with PERMANOVA; (3) differential abundance analysis using LEfSe (LDA score > 2.0, P P P = 0.01). The stricturing group showed marked enrichment of Alternaria (P = 0.03) and an increased Basidiomycota/Ascomycota ratio, suggesting phylum-level shifts in fungal composition. Notably, Alternaria and Penicillium abundances exhibited significant negative correlations with systemic inflammatory markers (WBC counts, P P Alternaria enrichment and LOXL-mediated ECM remodeling as potential therapeutic targets.

Intestinal cleanliness (quantified by the KODA score and qualitatively evaluated), patient acceptability, diagnostic yield, capsule completion rate, and SB transit time (SBTT) were compared between groups.ResultsWith 142 SBCE, we observed no difference in intestinal cleanliness. Patients' acceptability of preparation and SBCE procedure was significantly higher with the simplified preparation. Diagnostic yield was similar, as well as the capsule completion rate and SBTT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the KODA score was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90).

To optimize the delivery of care and therapeutic endpoints, involvement of multidisciplinary teams and treat-to-target approaches are recommended. Conventional medical therapies have only limited relevance. 5-aminosalicylates should not be used and corticosteroids are at best suitable for short-term control of acute flares. The therapeutic benefit of thiopurines is viewed with caution due to potential side effects and their inferior efficacy compared to infliximab. Advanced therapies (antibodies and small molecules) should be selected with regard to individual patient factors. TNF antibodies continue to be a mainstay of Crohn's therapy. IL-23 antibodies appear to be effective alternatives following loss of response to TNF antibodies. Nutritional therapies have so far been given too little consideration in clinical practice. Exclusive enteral nutrition can be used in children or compliant adults. Other diets including Mediterranean diet can be applied to maintain remission. Surgical treatment of Crohn's disease may be increasingly used in early stages of the disease, as it can avoid long-term complications and medical therapies.

Individuals suffering from Crohn's disease are at an increased risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which considerably exacerbates symptoms. Using a prospective observational clinical study combined with animal models of intestinal inflammation, we show that intestinal colonization by Veillonella, an oral commensal, promotes CDI in Crohn's disease. In mice, Veillonella parvula suppresses expression of the main bile acid transporter, ASBT, thus preventing bile acid reabsorption. Similarly, Veillonella abundance is associated with increased bile acid metabolism in Crohn's disease patients. This increase in bile acid availability within the intestinal lumen triggers C. difficile germination. V. parvula expresses a highly pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide that triggers the transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos regulating ASBT expression. These findings highlight that oral commensals can exacerbate intestinal disease, providing pathways to design therapeutics to treat CDI in Crohn's disease patients.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundWe investigated the relationship between nut and legume intake and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 223 283 adults from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2017), excluding those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at baseline. Food frequency questionnaires were used to calculate nut and legume intake. Inflammatory bowel disease was self-reported on questionnaires and confirmed via blinded record review. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CD and UC according to categories of nut and legume intake.ResultsIn over 5 460 315 person-years of follow-up (CD = 371, UC = 481), neither nut nor legume intake was associated with CD or UC risk. Compared to those who never consumed nuts, those who consumed nuts ≥2 times/week had an aHR = 0.96 (95% CI, 0.63-1.47; Ptrend = 0.57) for CD and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.92-1.84; Ptrend = 0.36) for UC. Compared to those who consumed legumes 0-3 times/month, those who consumed legumes ≥4 times/week had an aHR of 1.26 (95% CI, 0.78-2.04; Ptrend = 0.59) for CD and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.44-1.18; Ptrend = 0.20) for UC. Baseline BMI modified the relationship between nut intake and CD risk (Pint = 0.03). In those with BMI ≥25, the aHR for CD was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.03-0.56; P = .006) per additional serving/day of nuts compared with 0.88 (95% CI, 0.45-1.74; P = .72) for those with BMI ConclusionsNut and legume intake were not associated with CD or UC risk. However, higher nut intake decreased CD risk in overweight or obese individuals. Thus, personalized-risk stratification, rather than generalized dietary recommendations, may be important for IBD prevention strategies.",

Limiting corticosteroid exposure is an important goal in treating CD. This posthoc analysis evaluated the corticosteroid-sparing effects of upadacitinib in patients with CD.Design and settingThis study included pooled data from two phase 3, multicenter, double-blind induction trials and one maintenance trial. Randomization was stratified by corticosteroid use at induction baseline, with a mandatory corticosteroid taper starting at induction week 4. Efficacy was evaluated by baseline corticosteroid use and by achieving corticosteroid-free outcomes through year 2 of maintenance therapy. Safety was also assessed.ResultsAt baseline, 34.7% (234/674) and 35.7% (124/347) of upadacitinib 45 mg and placebo-treated patients were taking corticosteroids, respectively. At induction week 12 and maintenance week 52, higher rates of upadacitinib-treated patients were corticosteroid-free among all patients and among patients with baseline corticosteroid use compared with placebo; upadacitinib-treated patients achieved higher rates of corticosteroid-free outcomes, compared with placebo, including corticosteroid-free clinical remission (stool frequency/abdominal pain score [SF/APS]: 42.7% vs 16.1%; CD activity index [CDAI]: 41.2% vs 23.4%) and corticosteroid-free endoscopic response (37.0% vs 8.1%), with similar results observed among responders to upadacitinib induction therapy at maintenance week 52. Corticosteroid-free outcomes were sustained through year 2 of maintenance therapy. The safety profile was similar to the overall population, with no new safety risks identified.Conclusions and relevanceThe results from pivotal studies demonstrated that upadacitinib effectively induced early and sustainable corticosteroid-free clinical remission with a manageable safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe CD.Clinical trial identifiersU-EXCEL, U-EXCEED, and U-ENDURE ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03345849, NCT03345836, and NCT03345823.",

The purpose of this study is to identify a portable and reliable indicator for assessing and predicting activity and severity of CD.DesignA multicentre, cross-sectional, diagnosis-based study. Data were obtained retrospectively from clinical records.SettingPatient data for the development cohort and internal validation cohort were collected from the Department of Gastroenterology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University between January 2017 and June 2021. Patient data for the external validation cohort were collected from the Department of Gastroenterology, Xiangtan Central Hospital between January 2022 and April 2024.ParticipantsInpatients diagnosed with CD were potential participants, and those with CD who also had other autoimmune diseases, malignant tumours, pregnancy or lactation were excluded. We identified 224 patients in the development cohort, 96 patients in the internal validation cohort and 80 patients in the external validation cohort.Outcome measureDemographic data and laboratory examination results were collected and seven integrated indices were established. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis K test, χ2 test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify independent predictors. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to evaluate the performance of integrated indices in CD activity and severity staging, and Delong's test was used for comparison.ResultsIn the development cohort, platelet-to-albumin ratio (PAR) had the largest area under the curve (AUC) in prediction of activity (AUC of 0.753 (0.687-0.819), sensitivity 73.0%, specificity 68.4%, cut-off value 8.02) and was the only possible alternative in prediction of severity (AUC of 0.770 (0.693-0.848), sensitivity 81.2%, specificity 68.4%, cut-off value 9.71). Moreover, PAR demonstrated coherence in the internal validation cohort, effectively predicting activity (AUC 0.737 (0.639-0.835), sensitivity 65.7%, specificity 79.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) 50.0%) and severity (AUC 0.720 (0.591-0.848), sensitivity 88.5%, specificity 77.4%, PPV 76.7%, NPV 64.9%). Furthermore, it showed generalisability in the external validation cohort for predicting activity (AUC 0.661 (0.536-0.785), sensitivity 61.9%, specificity 70.6%, PPV 88.6%, NPV 33.3%) and severity (AUC 0.752 (0.619-0.884), sensitivity 73.1%, specificity 64.9%, PPV 59.4%, NPV 77.4%).ConclusionsPAR could be a portable index to assess the activity and severity of CD. Several limitations of this study, such as the limited sample size and potential biases, should be overcome in the future via more extensive validation.",

The mechanisms behind this anti-TNF nonresponse are unknown but are likely multifactorial. Here, we examined myeloid cells expressing signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) for their potential role in refractory CD.MethodsResponse to anti-TNF was defined as having reached endoscopic and histological healing, whereas nonresponders did not. Isolated cells from peripheral blood and mucosal biopsies were analyzed by high dimensional flow cytometry, single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, and Luminex. Ileal organoids were also challenged with secretomes from stimulated SIRPα+ cells.ResultsAmong the CD phenotypes, patients with anti-TNF refractory CD had the highest levels of CD33+HLA-DR+CD11c+SIRPα+ cells in their intestinal mucosa, but the levels in peripheral blood were unchanged. SIRPα+ cells from the gut displayed a higher proinflammatory transcriptome, with increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNFα, p40, and IL-1β expression. When isolated and stimulated in vitro with flagellin, these SIRPα+ cells showed a more pro-inflammatory transcriptome during CD47 ligation than with an IgG control. Moreover, the secretomes of flagellin/CD47-stimulated SIRPα+ cells from patients with refractory CD increased cell death and promoted gene expression associated with Rho GTPase and innate immune responses in epithelial cells, while downregulating their gene expression involved in RNA, lipid metabolism, and adaptive response signaling.ConclusionsIncreased levels of myeloid lineage expressing CD33+HLA-DR+CD11c+SIRPα+ cells in the intestinal mucosa negatively impact epithelial cell function, possibly explaining one mechanism for anti-TNF resistance. The abundance of mucosal SIRPα+ cells should be further explored as a biomarker and therapeutic target.",

Upadacitinib is a JAK inhibitor with greater selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 and JAK3, and is emerging as a promising alternative to biologic therapies in CD.Areas coveredA literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE up to February 2025 was conducted using defined keywords to identify preclinical, clinical, and real-world studies on upadacitinib in CD. In early trials, upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy in reducing proinflammatory cytokines, improving intestinal barrier integrity, and achieving high intracellular drug concentrations in target tissues. The phase II CELEST trial demonstrated that upadacitinib induced both endoscopic and clinical responses in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. Subsequent phase III studies (U-EXCEED, U-EXCEL, U-ENDURE) confirmed rapid clinical remission, sustained efficacy, and a manageable safety profile, leading to regulatory approval. The efficacy and safety of this molecule in CD have been confirmed by real-world studies.Expert opinionThe currently available data suggests that upadacitinib is an effective oral therapy for CD, offering an alternative to biologics with predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid symptom relief, and sustained long-term benefits.

Current trial endpoints and their limitations are discussed, highlighting the need for more patient-centric approaches, including increased use of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and IUS. Intestinal ultrasonography offers several advantages: it is noninvasive, requires no sedation, bowel preparation, or exposure to ionizing radiation, and enables real-time assessment of disease activity. It also demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for detecting transmural inflammation and complications such as strictures, abscesses, and fistulas. Compared with cross-sectional imaging modalities like MRE and computed tomography, IUS is more patient-friendly, cost-effective, and suitable for point-of-care examination. However, challenges remain, including the lack of a universally accepted disease activity scoring system for MRE or IUS, despite the development and validation of several scoring tools. Key unmet needs include standardization of image acquisition and reporting, adequate training of healthcare professionals, improved access to equipment, and reimbursement pathways. Intestinal ultrasonography is increasingly being integrated into clinical trials to assess transmural inflammatory changes in CD, with IUS-based measures of transmural remission or response showing promise as potential endpoints. Although its advantages are clear, addressing these unmet needs is essential to broaden the adoption of IUS in both clinical trials and routine clinical practice.",

Inflammation is hypothesized to be a key mediator in the progression of CHIP to hematologic malignancy and patients with CHIP have a high prevalence of inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and characteristics of CHIP in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).MethodsWe analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 587 Crohn's disease (CD), 441 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 293 non-IBD controls to assess CHIP prevalence and used logistic regression to study associations with clinical outcomes.ResultsOlder UC patients (age > 45) harbored increased myeloid-CHIP mutations compared to younger patients (age ≤ 45) (P = .01). Lymphoid-CHIP was more prevalent in older IBD patients (P = .007). Young CD patients were found to have myeloid-CHIP with high-risk features. Inflammatory bowel disease patients with CHIP exhibited unique mutational profiles compared to controls. Steroid use was associated with increased CHIP (P = .05), while anti-TNF therapy was associated with decreased myeloid-CHIP (P = .03). Pathway enrichment analyses indicated an overlap between CHIP genes, IBD phenotypes, and inflammatory pathways.ConclusionsOur findings underscore a connection between IBD and CHIP pathophysiology. Patients with IBD and CHIP had unique risk profiles, especially among older UC patients and younger CD patients. These findings suggest distinct evolutionary pathways for CHIP in IBD and necessitate awareness among IBD providers and hematologists to identify patients potentially at risk for CHIP-related complications including malignancy, cardiovascular disease, and acceleration of their inflammatory disease.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundCrohn's disease (CD) involves chronic intestinal inflammation, frequently requiring surgical intervention. CD patients undergoing surgery often undergo increased psychological stress. One of the outcomes of persistent stress is post-traumatic stress (PTS), a mental health concern associated with immune dysregulation and disease progression. However, research on PTS in CD patients following surgery is limited.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the incidence and associated factors of PTS in CD patients after surgery.DesignA retrospective cross-sectional study.MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study investigated 124 patients with CD who underwent surgery between September 2015 and July 2023. Online questionnaires, including the PTSD checklist, 5th edition (PCL-5), Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge Score, and Short Generic Patient Experience Questionnaire, were employed. The potential risk factors for PTS were evaluated through univariate and multivariate analyses.ResultsAmong sampled individuals, 44 patients (35.5%) were classified into the PTS group. The patients in the PTS group had a significant lower monthly income (27.3% vs 8.8%, p = 0.006), higher Harvey-Bradshaw Index score (3.82 ± 3.25 vs 2.31 ± 2.50, p = 0.009), more occurrence of perianal lesions (36.4% vs 20%, p = 0.047), higher ostomy (36.4% vs 20%, p = 0.047), and laparotomy rates (31.8% vs 15%, p = 0.028). Through logistic regression analysis, we identified postoperative complications and a history of multiple surgeries as independent risk factors for PTS (p = 0.002 and p = 0.019, respectively).ConclusionPTS is common in CD patients requiring bowel resection and multiple surgeries, as well as other postoperative related factors, can invoke psychological and mental stress. These findings provide insights for formulating medical service strategies that prioritize patient mental health.",

We aimed to explore the role of cuproptosis-related proteins in CD using bioinformatics.MethodsIntegrated microarray dataset (including 494 cases total, including CD inflammatory tissue and control tissue) and single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE184291, comprising 25,121 cells from inflammatory and non-inflammatory tissue). Combined with the cuproptosis gene set, batch correction, differential expression analysis, enrichment analysis, WGCNA, and PPI network analysis were performed. A CD diagnostic model based on cuproptosis-related genes was established and validated on an external dataset. Single-cell analysis further characterized cellular heterogeneity, the distribution of diagnostic markers across cell populations, and cell communication features.ResultsFour cuproptosis-related protein markers-CD274, PDK1, CP, and SLC31A2-were identified to be upregulated in CD and validated via RT-qPCR. These markers were not only enriched in metabolism-related pathways but were also strongly connected to immune cells, with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) being a potential central node. The diagnostic model demonstrated robust performance, with an area under the curve of 0.789 in an internal validation and 0.806 in an external validation. The single-cell analysis provided initial, hypothesis-generating insights into the immune microenvironment in CD.ConclusionsThis study identified four potential protein markers for CD: CD274, PDK1, CP, and SLC31A2. Our findings suggest a correlation among cuproptosis, metabolism, and immunity. Further studies are required to experimentally validate these associations and explore the potential of markers as therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundVedolizumab is efficacious in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease. However, prospective data about its efficacy in early Crohn's disease are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the ability of vedolizumab to promote clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission in patients with early and late active Crohn's disease over a 1-year period.MethodsThis phase 4 investigator-initiated, open-label cohort study was conducted at 22 hospitals in Belgium, Hungary, and the Netherlands. Eligible patients were adults aged 18-80 years with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 220-450, with ulcers at endoscopy). Patients were divided into two groups: those with early Crohn's disease (defined as a diagnosis less than 2 years ago and naive to advanced treatment [naive or only treated with corticosteroids or immunomodulators, or both]); and those with late Crohn's disease (defined as a diagnosis more than 2 years ago and previously treated with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and anti-TNF agents). Patients received intravenous vedolizumab (300 mg) at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter for 52 weeks, with an additional 300 mg infusion at week 10 in the absence of a decrease in CDAI of more than 70 at week 6. Colonoscopies with biopsies were done at screening, week 26, and week 52, and assessed by masked independent readers with the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical and endoscopic remission (defined as CDAI ≤150 and SES-CD FindingsBetween July 10, 2015, and July 1, 2022, 86 patients with early Crohn's disease (45 [52·3%] female and 41 [47·7%] male) and 174 with late Crohn's disease (111 [63·8%] female and 63 [36·2%] male) were enrolled. Clinical and endoscopic remission at both week 26 and 52 was achieved in 27 (31·4%) of 86 patients with early Crohn's disease versus 15 (8·6%) of 174 patients with late Crohn's disease (difference 22·8%, 95% CI 12·6-33·7). Serious adverse events occurred in three (3·5%) of 86 patients with early Crohn's disease versus 46 (26·4%) of 174 patients with late Crohn's disease and included infections (one [1·2%] vs 13 [7·5%]), surgery (none vs eight [4·6%]), intestinal obstruction (none vs four [2·3%]), exacerbation of Crohn's disease (one [1·2%] vs six [3·4%]), and malignancy (none vs three [1·7%]).InterpretationVedolizumab treatment is safer and more effective in early than in late Crohn's disease.

      "abstract": "Poorly controlled Crohn's disease is associated with several complications, including malabsorption of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D, vitamin B12, and vitamin B1 (thiamine). Thiamine, among other vitamins, plays a crucial role in Adenosine Triphosphate formation as well as nerve propagation. Thiamine deficiency initially manifests as wet or dry beriberi but may lead to the devastating Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In this report, we present a case of full-blown Wernicke encephalopathy associated with uncontrolled Crohn's disease. An 18-year-old young man was admitted with a chief complaint of hematemesis for 2 weeks before admission. He was previously diagnosed with Crohn's disease in the past year, with constipation as the predominant symptom, and has been taking mesalazine 500 mg twice daily. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy re-evaluation showed a worsening picture of Crohn's disease pangastritis. The patient experienced swelling in both legs, the scrotum, and the upper extremities during hospital admission. On day 14 of hospitalization, the patient fell into a state of confusion with visual and auditory hallucinations, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. A Brain MRI showed a typical picture of Wernicke encephalopathy. Intravenous thiamine was administered, and the patient regained consciousness. His clinical symptoms improved every day until he was discharged. Uncontrolled Crohn's disease may have several complications that clinicians need to be aware of, including thiamine deficiency. Wernicke encephalopathy shows a devastating clinical picture, but with thiamine therapy, it may resolve before further deterioration leads to irreversible Korsakoff syndrome.",

      "abstract": "RationaleThe incidence of pediatric Crohn's disease has been steadily increasing. In this population, the disease often presents with more extensive inflammation, a tendency toward a more aggressive course, and frequently requires early immunomodulation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies work by neutralizing pro-inflammatory effectors, thus interrupting the inflammatory cascade. There is broad consensus that biologics are effective in achieving mucosal healing in Crohn's disease. Despite this, several important questions about anti-TNF therapy in children and adolescents remain unanswered. These include determining the optimal dosing regimen for both safety and durability, identifying the ideal timing for initiating anti-TNF treatment before irreversible bowel damage occurs, and deciding whether to use a top-down or step-up approach tailored to the individual patient's disease location, behavior, and other predictors of complicated outcomes.ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy and safety of TNF-alpha antagonists for induction of remission in children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database) (BIREME), and Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (Web of Science). We applied no language or document type restrictions. The last update of evidence was on 1 June 2024.Eligibility criteriaWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language, assessing the benefits and harms of TNF-alpha antagonist for induction of remission treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were induction of clinical remission and incidence of serious adverse effects. Important outcomes were all-cause mortality and morbidity related to Crohn's disease, endoscopic remission, incidence of steroid withdrawal, proportion of participants in need of surgical intervention, loss of response to anti-TNF, and incidence of mild adverse events.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool. The only included trial was at overall high risk of bias.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methodology to perform this systematic review. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence per outcome.Included studiesOnly one study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The study was an open-label, multicenter RCT conducted in 12 hospitals in three European countries, and included 100 children (51 boys and 49 girls) newly diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with a 52-week follow-up. Children were randomly assigned to first-line infiximab (FL-IFX) (n = 50) or conventional treatment (n = 50). The trial was at overall high risk of bias.Synthesis of resultsClinical remission was achieved by 59% (24/41) in the FL-IFX group versus 34% (15/44) in the conventional-treatment group, therefore favoring FL-IFX (risk ratio [RR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 2.79; low certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission was achieved by 59% (16/27) in the FL-IFX group versus 17% (5/30) in the conventional-treatment group, therefore favoring FL-IFX (RR 3.56, 95% CI 1.51 to 8.39; low certainty evidence). The included study did not assess all-cause morbidity or mortality related to Crohn's disease or incidence of serious or mild adverse events. No funding information was provided. This study is part of the TISKid study, which is in development and includes the same population with a planned follow-up of five years.Authors' conclusionsThere is limited evidence to support the use of anti-TNF therapy for induction of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. Only one randomized clinical trial at high risk of bias suggests that FL-IFX may result in a slight increase in induction of clinical remission and endoscopic remission when compared to conventional treatment. The results of this trial need to be interpreted with caution. Several important questions remain regarding the optimal timing of anti-TNF therapy, the preference between step-up versus top-down strategies, and other related issues. Further RCTs are needed to achieve stronger evidence, address these questions, and provide clearer guidance. There is a need for larger randomized clinical trials following the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements, assessing the benefits and harms of using anti-TNF versus conventional therapy for pediatric Crohn's disease induction treatment.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationThe intervention protocol was published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2022, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014497.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundCertain patients with Crohn's disease (CD) concomitantly develop psoriasis (PS), whilst the typical features and underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. The present study was intended to identify the clinical and proteomic features of CD with concomitant PS (CDPS) in order to enhance future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this type of comorbidity.MethodsA retrospective, single-centre study was conducted for patients with CD, CDPS, and idiopathic PS. Student's t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Chi-square test were employed to examine the similarities and differences of clinical characteristics of these patients. Intestinal mucosa, serum, urine proteomics and metaproteomics were conducted for healthy control (HC), CD and CDPS subjects. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J, Hgfac knockout and Krt7 knockout mice (male, 8-10 weeks old) were studied using the Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) induced colitis model and imiquimod induced psoriasis model.FindingsTen patients with CDPS were enrolled. All patients had infliximab (IFX) exposure history but the IFX response rates were lower. The disease site (L3) and perianal lesions of the CDPS group showed statistically significant differences compared with those in the CD group. Moreover, blood inflammatory indicators and triglyceride levels were higher in the CDPS group. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in the age of onset, PS type, and PS activity score between the CDPS group and the idiopathic PS group. Therapeutic response results showed that all the patients experienced improvement of their PS whilst some of their intestinal lesions remained active after the treatment with ustekinumab (UST). Additionally, Intestinal mucosa proteomic results showed that CDPS group exhibited higher activation of immune-related pathways, increased keratin formation and impaired intestinal mucosal mitochondrial function leading to reduced activity of metabolism-related pathways. Serum and urine proteomics revealed that the significant downregulation of hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFAC) in patients with CDPS impedes lipid metabolism. Metaproteomic analysis showed that the CDPS group had reduced abundance of lipid metabolism-associated microbes, leading to increased lipid deposition in the intestinal mucosa and consequently, an enhanced inflammatory response. And in animal experiments, HGFAC knockout mice developed markedly more severe colitis and skin inflammation, whereas KRT7 knockout mice and those Megasphaera micronuciformis treated mice exhibited attenuated disease phenotypes.InterpretationPatients with CD who have extensive and perianal lesions are more likely to develop PS. Furthermore, patients with CDPS suffer from more severe disease progression, poorer prognosis and lower response rate to biological agents. Aberrant activation of immune signalling in the intestinal mucosa, increased expression of keratins and impaired mitochondrial metabolic function are potential reasons for the more severe intestinal inflammation in patients with CDPS. Downregulation of circulating HGFAC and reduction of microbes associated with lipid metabolism elevate blood triglyceride levels, and triglycerides lead to significant activation of immune cells in the skin, which is accompanied by an increase in circulating immunoglobulins, which may represent a key mechanism for the development of PS in patients with CD. Our study has elucidated the potential pathogenesis of CDPS, and the combination of clinical and proteomic analysis may provide valuable insights for reference into the management and therapeutic targets of this type of comorbidity.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Funds of China (82370529, 82303391), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund (2022A1515111193), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Project (2023A04J0581), the Featured Clinical Technique of Guangzhou (2023C-TS34), and the Science and Technology Projects in Guangzhou (202201020142 and 2024B03J0466).",

So far, research has focused primarily on clinical and surgical recurrence rates in the ileum, leaving endoscopic recurrence largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to explore the endoscopic ileal recurrence rate in patients with a long-term ileostomy and to identify potential risk factors.MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of adult CD patients with a long-term ileostomy (≥12 months) at a tertiary referral center.ResultsThrough an electronic health record database search, we were able to identify 150 patients. One hundred sixteen patients (77.3%) underwent at least one endoscopic examination of the ileum. Ileal recurrence was detected in 46/116 (39.7%). The 1, 3, and 5-year endoscopic recurrence rates were 11.2%, 27.3%, and 33.0%, respectively. Patients with earlier ileal involvement (hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.62; P = .02) or previous biological therapy (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.25-4.89; P = .01) were at higher risk.

      "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies have established a role for Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, these studies excluded patients with an ileostomy.AimWe sought to evaluate the clinical response of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ileostomy who were treated with upadacitinib.MethodsThis retrospective study included patients with CD who had an ileostomy secondary to medically refractory CD and who were treated with upadacitinib. Patients who underwent ileostomy takedown and continued taking upadacitinib were analyzed separately from patients with an ileostomy throughout upadacitinib treatment duration. The primary endpoint was clinical response defined by either continuation or discontinuation of upadacitinib. The secondary endpoint was identifying variables that lead to discontinuation of upadacitinib.ResultsA total of 48 patients, between the ages of 17-70 years met our inclusion criteria of having CD, an ileostomy, and upadacitinib use after ileostomy creation. Of the 48 patients, 32 (67%) had clinical improvement in CD activity with upadacitinib use based on review of clinical documentation. Upadacitinib was discontinued in 16 patients (33%) for various reasons including refractory symptoms related to CD, deep vein thrombosis, anemia/leukopenia, insurance denial, pregnancy planning, headache/back pain, or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.ConclusionWe evaluated the efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with CD and ileostomy. Two-thirds of our cohort experienced improvement in CD-related symptoms with upadacitinib use. Further studies are needed to evaluate if altered gastrointestinal anatomy significantly impacts absorption and efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with CD.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundDespite significant advances in the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease (CD), a subset of patients remains refractory to available treatments. Dual-targeted therapy (DTT), combining biologics or biologics with small molecules, has emerged as a promising approach. While evidence supporting DTT continues to grow, reports of patients treated with a combination of 3 biologic or targeted agents remain exceptionally rare.Case presentationWe report the case of a 30-year-old male with a complex clinical course, initially diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and later reclassified as CD following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, due to subsequent small bowel and perianal involvement. The patient also had concomitant ankylosing spondylitis. Despite multiple lines of therapy, including, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and upadacitinib, both CD and ankylosing spondylitis remained clinically active. In the absence of alternative therapeutic options and continued refusal of surgery, a triple combination of certolizumab pegol, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab was initiated and maintained over 10 months. While the treatment was well tolerated and ankylosing spondylitis remained in remission, no impact was observed on CD.DiscussionThis case highlights the challenges of managing refractory inflammatory bowel disease with overlapping immune-mediated conditions. Although the combination of biologics targeting distinct inflammatory pathways is conceptually appealing and supported by emerging data on DTT, the effectiveness of triple therapy remains uncertain in some patients.ConclusionsTriple biologic therapy remains experimental and should be approached with caution, pending more robust evidence. Larger and translational studies are needed to better identify patients who may benefit, define optimal combinations, and clarify long-term safety of these combinations.",

An accurate diagnosis is important to avoid unnecessary treatment. Nontyphoidal Salmonella species are an important cause of infectious colitis that at times can mimic IBD. Salmonella enterica serotype Saintpaul has caused numerous fatal foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. It has also been known to cause other infections, such as bacteremia, splenic abscesses, and meningitis, but has only rarely been known to cause colitis. Worryingly, antibiotic resistance rates of S.

      "abstract": "Background: Perianal Crohn's disease (pCD) is one of the most disabling complications of inflammatory bowel disease, characterized by fistulas and abscesses that demand precise imaging for diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the reference standard, but endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) with high-frequency 360° probes provide a readily available, cost-effective, and repeatable alternative. Methods: We performed a narrative review of the literature, evaluating studies on the EAUS technique, diagnostic applications, distinguishing features of Crohn's-related fistulas, and comparative analyses with MRI. Consensus documents and structured reporting initiatives were also included. Results: EAUS provides high-resolution visualization of the anal sphincter complex and intersphincteric space, enabling the reliable detection of fistulas and abscesses. Characteristic features such as tract width > 4 mm, bifurcation, hyperechoic debris, the Crohn's Ultrasound Fistula Sign (CUFS), and the rosary sign assist in differentiating Crohn's from cryptoglandular fistulas. EAUS is well-suited for serial monitoring, perioperative seton guidance, and therapeutic decision-making. Emerging tools such as Doppler and shear wave elastography provide additional information on activity and fibrosis. MRI remains indispensable for supralevator disease, deep pelvic sepsis, and standardized activity indices. Comparative studies indicate similar sensitivity for simple fistulas, with MRI superior in complex cases; combining both modalities maximizes accuracy. Conclusions: EAUS is a practical and repeatable imaging tool that complements MRI in the multidisciplinary management of perianal Crohn's disease. Advances such as 3D imaging, contrast enhancement, and elastography may enable validated activity scoring-for example, a future PEACE (Perianal Endosonographic Activity in Chron's Evaluation) Index-further strengthening its role in longitudinal care.",

      "abstract": "Interleukin-23 (IL-23), a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, plays a critical role in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therapies targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23 have recently expanded the therapeutic options for IBD demonstrating efficacy and safety for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). Thus, in this review, we provide an overview of agents targeting the IL-23 pathway in CD, highlighting similarities and differences of specific IL-23 inhibitors. Furthermore, we summarize key phase 3 trials and head-to-head trials, focusing on design features and interpretation. Finally, we discuss the positioning of selective IL-23 agents for CD treatment along with areas of unmet clinical needs. However, real-world data will offer additional comparative effectiveness information, data for disease subtypes, and insights into the long-term outcomes of IL-23 inhibition. Looking ahead, ongoing phase 3 studies testing p19-specific selective IL-23 inhibitors are expected to expand the therapeutic options for patients with complex phenotypes, including those with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), fistulas, and strictures. Advances in molecular and cellular characterization, including the development of predictive molecular biomarkers, may help guide clinical decision-making, enabling more personalized treatment approaches. Precision medicine studies may further enhance our understanding of the molecular biology of IL-23, shedding light on how these agents work in complex CD and clarify their potential complementary or synergistic effects with other therapies.",

Prior biologic therapy had been used in 25 patients (75.8%), including 7 patients with one biologic and 18 patients with two or more biologics. Extraintestinal manifestations were observed in 12 patients (36.4%), and perianal lesions in 15 patients (45.5%). All patients started upadacitinib at 45 mg/day. The clinical response, clinical remission, and steroid-free clinical remission rates were 76.7%, 53.3%, and 36.7% by week 4; 83.3%, 63.3%, and 56.7% by week 8; and 86.7%, 70%, and 70% by week 12, respectively. Significant improvements in CDAI, serum CRP, and albumin were observed at week 12 or the last visit, compared to baseline. Improvement was observed in 66.7% of cases with extraintestinal manifestations and 46.7% of cases with perianal lesions. Adverse events occurred in 45.5% of patients, with acne being the most common (12.1%). No serious adverse events leading to death were reported. The continuation rate of upadacitinib at week 12 or the last visit was 93.3%.ConclusionUpadacitinib demonstrated high induction efficacy and acceptable safety in Japanese patients with active CD.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, with uncertain etiologies. The natural course of IBD can be accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations involving the skin, mucous membranes, musculoskeletal structures, eyes, cardiovascular system and nervous system. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a type of peripheral neuropathy. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD combined with GBS are unclear, and only a few clinical cases have been reported. Here, we report a case of refractory CD complicated by GBS and review the previous literature to improve the understanding of these diseases.Case summaryA 34-year-old man had a 9-year history of refractory CD. He became unresponsive to multiple drugs and experienced recurrent intestinal fistulas. After several abdominal surgeries and treatment with ustekinumab, he achieved clinical remission. Unfortunately, he developed GBS during maintenance treatment with ustekinumab. According to previous reports, in some patients with IBD combined with GBS, GBS may be a comorbidity, an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, or an adverse reaction to IBD therapeutic drugs. After a comprehensive evaluation, we suspected that GBS might have been a comorbidity in this patient. To avoid fatal disease relapse after medication discontinuation, we concluded that ustekinumab should not be withdrawn. On the basis of a joint decision between doctors and the patient, we decided to continue maintenance treatment with ustekinumab along with intravenous immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture, which resulted in a steady improvement in his GBS symptoms and sustained remission of CD.ConclusionWhen IBD is complicated by a neurological disease, it is first necessary to analyze the patient's condition and then choose the corresponding treatment strategy. If the neurological disease is a specific comorbidity, treatment of both IBD and the comorbid disease should be considered. For IBD patients with extraintestinal manifestations involving the nervous system, neurological manifestations tend to resolve when the active IBD is controlled. When an adverse drug reaction is suspected, the medication should be discontinued, and symptomatic treatment should be administered.",

Unlike conventional therapies, guselkumab offers a different mechanism of action by selectively inhibiting IL-23, a key cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of CD. IL-23 drives intestinal inflammation through activation of the Th17 cell pathway and other immune processes, positioning IL-23 inhibition as a critical therapeutic approach. In randomized Phase III clinical trials, guselkumab proved to be effective in inducing clinical and endoscopic remission both in patients naive to biologics and in patients already exposed to advanced therapies. Furthermore, no safety issues were found, supporting the well-characterized safety in other indications and its use in clinical practice also in IBD. Moreover, guselkumab has been approved for other immunomediated inflammatory disease moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. This review summarizes the available evidence on efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate to severe CD, focusing on its positioning in the treatment algorithm.",

A large number of articles have been published on Crohn's disease in children; however, there is still a lack of studies that use visualization methods for bibliometric analysis of relevant literature. The purpose of this paper is to statistically analyze the published literature in the field of Crohn's disease in children in order to help in the future diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease in children.MethodsLiterature meeting the inclusion criteria was screened from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Literature was visualized and analyzed by author, country, institution, journal, reference, and keyword using Citespace (6.2.R4) and VOSviewer (1.6.18).ResultsA total of 3,177 eligible publications were included. There is an overall increasing trend in the number of annual publications.Turner, Dan published the most number of articles with 78 and has a high impact in the field of CD. The most cited author was Levine, A. Among countries and institutions, the United States and Tel Aviv University had the highest number of publications. The journal with the most publications is Journal Of Pediatric Gastroenterology And Nutrition. The most co-cited journal was Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. The most cited document was ESPGHAN Revised Porto Criteria for the Diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children and Adolescents, and the most cited document with the highest outbreak intensity was The Medical Management of Paediatric Crohn's Disease: an ECCO-ESPGHAN Guideline Update.The most frequent keyword was \"inflammatory bowel disease\".ConclusionThis study provides a visual summary of information for the field of pediatric Crohn's disease and contributes to international collaboration to promote research in the field of pediatric Crohn's disease.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota composition in Crohn's disease (CD) patients may influence their response to ustekinumab (UST) therapy. A total of 51 patients with active CD undergoing UST therapy were prospectively enrolled. Clinical activity was evaluated using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and faecal microbiota were characterised by 16S rRNA sequencing at baseline and week 24. Microbial compositional and functional alterations were assessed, and their correlations with clinical outcomes were examined. At week 24, 46.7% of patients achieved clinical remission and 82.2% achieved clinical response. At baseline, Megamonas (p = 0.009) and Erysipelatoclostridium (p = 0.030) were enriched in the remission group, whereas Fusobacterium (p = 0.016) was more abundant in the non-remission group and correlated positively with C-reactive protein (CRP) but negatively with body mass index (BMI) and serum albumin (ALB). Longitudinal analysis showed that CR patients exhibited increased Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (p = 0.028) and decreased Granulicatella (p = 0.043) after 24 weeks. This study provides real-world evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of UST in Asian patients with active CD. The observed association between elevated baseline Fusobacterium abundance and poorer treatment response suggests a potential microbial influence on therapeutic outcomes. These findings highlight the potential of Fusobacterium as a predictive biomarker for UST response and could provide a rationale for integrating microbiota-modulating strategies to enhance the efficacy of biologics in the future.",

In these prediagnosis and postdiagnosis serum samples (median time span 3.9 years), we profiled antibody epitope repertoires against 344 000 rationally selected microbial, food and immune antigens using phage-display immunoprecipitation sequencing.ResultsPostdiagnosis, we observe reduced antibody frequencies against herpesviruses, particularly for Epstein-Barr virus and varicella zoster virus, and elevated antibody frequencies against specific enteroviruses, including adenovirus C and enterovirus types B and C. Even before diagnosis, individuals who ultimately developed Crohn's disease (CD) displayed elevated antibody reactivity against flagellins of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This CD-specific profile became even more pronounced postdiagnosis, suggesting the formation of IBD-specific antibody responses years before disease onset.ConclusionThis study is the first comprehensive high-resolution analysis of the exact antigenic nature of systemic antibody responses during the transition from prediagnostic to established IBD. The antibody signatures we found may represent a route to developing biomarkers that identify individuals at high risk of developing disease.",

However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the common genetic features and potential molecular mechanisms of CD and RA.MethodsMicroarray data of CD and RA in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were downloaded. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the coexpression modules related to CD and RA. The shared genes existing in CD and RA were subjected to gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis using R software. The results were validated by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis to enrich for common differential genes and unique genes in CD and RA. Based on CD-RA common hub genes, we explored the feasibility of developing new gene-antibody coupled targeted drugs for the treatment of CD-RA.ResultsEnrichment analysis of gene modules identified through WGCNA revealed disease pathway models suggesting potential mechanisms of RA secondary to CD. Furthermore, we identified key shared pathogenic genes between CD and RA, such as S100P and IL2RB that may be important targets for the treatment of both diseases.ConclusionThe study is the first to reveal the key pathways underlying the shared pathogenesis of CD and RA, identify novel candidate genes that could serve as biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets.

Disease activity was assessed using the Rutgeerts and modified Rutgeerts scores, POCER (postoperative Crohn's endoscopic recurrence) index, REMIND (groupe de REcherche sur les Maladies INflammatoires Digestives) score, Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD), and the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS).

Responsiveness was quantified using the win probability (WinP) defined as the probability that a patient in the treatment (infliximab) group had a better score than a patient in the placebo group. The neoterminal ileum, anastomosis, and distal colon were scored separately.ResultsInterrater reliability was substantial for the Rutgeerts and modified Rutgeerts scores, ileal REMIND score, SES-CD, and CDEIS (ICC 0.74-0.80), moderate for the POCER index (ICC 0.49), and fair for the anastomotic REMIND score (ICC 0.30).

Our primary outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission; analyses were stratified by biologic therapy exposure status. We performed a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise certainty of evidence.ResultsWe identified 28 trials of induction therapy and 22 trials of maintenance therapy of advanced therapies in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. In biologic-naïve patients, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab, and low certainty evidence supported the use of certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib over no treatment for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab and ustekinumab compared with certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib. Among patients with prior exposure to biologics, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, and upadacitinib, and low certainty evidence supported the use of vedolizumab and mirikizumab, over no treatment, for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate certainty evidence supported the use of risankizumab and guselkumab compared with vedolizumab and ustekinumab.ConclusionsUsing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundSmall bowel strictures are a common and challenging complication of Crohn's disease (CD), and predicting their responsiveness to medical therapy remains an unmet clinical need.ObjectiveStrictures, defined by the CONSTRICT consensus as a localized segment demonstrating luminal narrowing and bowel wall thickening, accompanied by pre-stenotic dilation, are a common feature of CD, impairing bowel function, complicating treatment, and often leading to surgery. Predicting which lesions are responsive to medical therapy and which will become obstructive represents an important clinical goal. We aim to characterize ileal strictures in patients with CD by exploring the bowel wall motility in patients receiving biologic agents and evaluating motility's potential role in predicting therapeutic response compared with standard MRE biomarkers.Materials and methodsThis retrospective study included subjects between 10-28 years of age with stricturing CD receiving immunotherapy who underwent modification or escalation of biologic therapy and clinically indicated magnetic resonance enterography within a 2-month window. All included patients had ileal strictures identified on magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) based on CONSTRICT criteria. Demographic and clinical variables of the overall cohort were obtained. Clinical response and disease activity were evaluated up to 6 months after therapy initiation or adjustment. Subjects were categorized as \"non-responders\" if they experienced worsening disease activity, required discontinuation of therapy, or needed surgical intervention. Simplified MR indexes of activity (sMaRIA) assessed the ileum, and motility data were processed using GIQuant® (Motilent Ltd., London, UK) software. Stricture length, volume, wall thickness, and T2 signal intensity were also measured using Motilent® software tools. Statistical analyses included t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables, chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, and ROC curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of motility and sMaRIA metrics in predicting treatment response. Significance was set at pResultsA total of 40 subjects (52.54% [n=21] female; mean age 19.77±5.13) were included, with 15 (37.5%) classified as non-responders. No significant differences were observed in age (P=0.60), sex (P=0.94), stricture length (P=0.64), wall thickness (P=0.34), stricture volume (P=0.42), or T2-weighted signal intensity (P=0.31). However, mean motility (176.03±128.63 vs. 67.83±33.88; P=0.006) and its standard deviation (72.06±55.55 vs. 30.27±25.79; P=0.02) were significantly higher in responders. sMaRIA scores were not significantly different between groups (mean 2.75 vs. 3.13; P=0.36). Motility outperformed sMaRIA (AUC 0.812 vs. 0.613; P=0.07) in predicting responses.ConclusionQuantitative MRI motility assessment was superior to traditional MRI biomarkers in predicting response to biologic therapy in adolescents and young adults with stricturing CD.",

Although IFX-associated invasive fungal infections have received widespread attention, IFX-associated superficial cutaneous fungal infections, such as Malassezia folliculitis (MF), have not been fully recognized. Herein, we present a case of a 19-year-old female patient with moderately active CD who rapidly developed facial erythema, inflammatory papules, and nodular lesions after treatment with IFX. Initially, she was diagnosed with acne vulgaris, but topical and oral antibiotic treatments were ineffective. After completing five IFX infusions, she not only had no relief of gastrointestinal symptoms, but also had progressive exacerbation of the cutaneous lesions. Fungal microscopy revealed abundant Malassezia spores, confirming the diagnosis of MF. Subsequently, IFX was discontinued, and treatment was switched to Ustekinumab (UST). Following this therapeutic adjustment, the patient demonstrated simultaneous resolution of both gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms. Notably, the facial lesions completely resolved after three UST infusions without the use of antifungal drugs. This case is the first report of MF induced by IFX therapy in a CD patient. It highlights that acneiform eruptions emerging during biologic therapy may represent cutaneous fungal manifestations. Early recognition and timely adjustment of treatment regimens are essential to prevent potential systemic fungal infections.",

The lowest correlations were found with deep ulcers in the ileum, descending colon, and rectum (CDEIS), and ulcer size in the ileum and stricture detection in the descending colon (SES-CD). Non-IBD experts showed higher interobserver agreement (ICC: 0.91 CDEIS, 0.88 SES-CD) compared to IBD experts (ICC: 0.79 for both). No correlation was found between endoscopic scores and Harvey-Bradshaw index or C-reactive protein (CRP). SES-CD showed a significant correlation with fecal calprotectin (0.58, p = 0.01) and CDEIS trended towards significance (r = 0.44, p = 0.064).

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate fistula outcomes after seton removal in patients with PFCD.MethodsMEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched until December 2023. We included studies reporting fistula outcomes after seton removal in PFCD. We used a hierarchy to stratify patients into one of three treatment categories: medical therapy alone, surgical closure, or cell/plasma-based therapy. Fistula outcomes were reported as weighted proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsEighty-two studies (n = 2441 patients) were analyzed. Mean/median seton duration varied widely (2 to 70 weeks). Pooled estimates (95% CI) of fistula outcomes after seton removal for patients treated in the medical therapy alone, surgical closure, or cell/plasma-based therapy categories were, respectively, 64% (54-75), 65% (52-78), and 71% (65-77) for fistula remission; 30% (22-38), 29% (16-42), and 20% (15-25) for recurrence; 15% (8-22), 11% (4-20), and 14% (8-21) for abscess formation; and 26% (18-35), 23% (17-29), and 13% (2-26) for surgical re-intervention. Fistula outcome estimates remained stable in multiple sensitivity analyses. Limited studies directly compared fistula outcomes based on seton duration, yielding inconsistent results.ConclusionsThis systematic review provides comprehensive estimates of fistula outcomes after seton removal and demonstrates substantial variability in seton duration. Future research is required to determine the optimal duration of setons.",

      "abstract": "First-line therapeutic approaches for Crohn's disease include immunosuppressants, aminosalicylates, and corticosteroids. However, more than one-third of patients are resistant to these treatments and require second-line therapies. Our goal was to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecules for inducing remission in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. A systematic review was conducted by searching for randomized controlled trials on the target population in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (March 2025). Data synthesis for the outcomes of remission, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety was performed using network meta-analyses and surface under the cumulative rating curve (SUCRA) analyses. The results were presented as risk ratios with 95% credible intervals. We included 55 trials (n = 16,113 patients) evaluating 26 biological drugs across 83 doses and six small molecules across 15 doses. Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analyses conducted across different measurement time points. Alongside infliximab 5 mg/kg (SUCRA 98.6%), 10 mg/kg (92%), and 20 mg/kg intravenous (91.8%), the recently approved drugs guselkumab 1200 mg (83.2%), 600 mg (89.2%), and 200 mg intravenous (90.1%), as well as mirikizumab 600 mg (91.5%) and 1000 mg intravenous (82.4%) presented higher probabilities of disease remission and were associated with increased HRQoL. Drugs such as certolizumab, andecaliximab, fontolizumab, abatacept, and etanercept ranked low for remission (SUCRA < 40%) and presented high probabilities of serious adverse events (over 60%). Small molecules presented an intermediate profile. Inhibitors of interleukin-23 appear to be promising alternatives for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Given their safety profile, some anti-TNF drugs should be avoided in practice. Trial Registration: PROSPERO: CRD42024519150.",

Cross-sectional imaging is widely used for their assessment, but definitions remain variable and non-standardised. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify commonly used imaging parameters, assess diagnostic performance, and evaluate consistency across studies.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) studies on CD-associated strictures, searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane to January 1, 2025. We included prospective and retrospective studies of small-bowel CD strictures with surgical histopathology as reference standard. Summary data were extracted from published reports and pooled using a random-effects bivariate meta-analysis, which jointly models sensitivity and specificity while accounting for between-study heterogeneity. Exclusion criteria were pediatric populations, colonic and upper-GI strictures. Main outcomes were stricture definitions and diagnostic performance. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251032918.FindingsOf the 9436 articles identified through the search, 30 met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis, comprising 1866 patients with CD: 5 on US, 7 on CT, 8 on MRI, and the remaining assessed two techniques. Luminal narrowing (LN), bowel wall thickening (BWT), and pre-stenotic dilation (PSD) were the most common descriptors. 4 studies (13%) required all three; the remaining used LN or BWT alone, with PSD often considered optional (20/30 [77%]). Overall, 26.7% (8/30) of studies were judged at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for US techniques to detect strictures were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.91) (I 2 = 0%), respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for MRE were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.90) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.44-0.95) (I 2 = 61.2%), and for CTE were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.90) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.47-0.93) (I 2 = 58.8%), respectively.InterpretationHigh diagnostic accuracy was observed across imaging modalities, with no statistically significant difference among them, and only a minority of studies at risk of bias unlikely to affect these findings. Heterogeneity existed in cut-offs and parameter combinations used to define strictures. PSD does not appear essential for stricture diagnosis, which could simplify diagnostic protocols.

Advanced dual-targeted therapy has emerged as a new treatment option in CD, but no data are available for perianal CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of advanced dual-targeted therapy for anoperineal fistulas (APFs) in CD patients.Materials and methodsWe prospectively included all consecutive patients receiving an advanced dual-targeted therapy for APFs from August 2019 to December 2023 in a single tertiary perianal CD centre. The primary outcome was clinical effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were patients' treatment perception, radiological effectiveness, luminal disease effectiveness, impact on extra-intestinal manifestations, and safety. Factors associated with complete clinical remission of APFs were identified using logistic regression.ResultsA total of 33 patients were included. The most frequently used advanced dual-targeted therapy was a combination of infliximab and ustekinumab (75.8%). After a median follow-up of 27.4 months, 48.5% and 97.0% of patients were in complete clinical remission and reported a perceived improvement, respectively. Complete radiological remission was achieved in 24.2% of the patients. A concomitant improvement in luminal intestinal involvement was observed in 46.1% of cases, and in extra-digestive manifestations in 45.8% of cases. Treatment tolerance was considered good or very good in 90.9% of cases. Associated anal ulcers and long-term exposure to antibiotics were associated with a lower likelihood of complete clinical remission for fistulas.ConclusionThese findings suggest that advanced dual-targeted therapy is a valid option with a good safety profile for the treatment of refractory APFs.

This underscores the urgent need for anti-fibrotic therapies. Our objective was to identify therapeutic targets and compounds capable of reversing the fibrotic gene expression profile of mucosal fibroblasts in CD.MethodsWe derived a fibrotic gene signature via fibroblasts isolated from stricturing CD tissue and conducted a meta-regression analysis across three publicly available transcriptomic datasets, to identify key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in fibrostenotic CD. Drug repurposing platforms (iLINCS, L1000, CLUE-io) were implemented to screen compounds with high druggability, for their potential to reverse this pro-fibrotic profile. Transcription factors, microRNAs, and drugs targeting the fibrostenotic signature were identified using the TRRUST, miRWalk, and DGIdb databases, ultimately forming a drug-gene interaction network. The STITCH platform was used to predict compound-protein binding affinities. Promising compounds were subsequently evaluated in vitro, using mucosal fibroblasts derived from fibrostenotic CD patients, and the effect on the expression of selected protein targets was measured via ELISA and immunofluorescence staining.ResultsThe top upregulated DEGs included fibroblast activation protein (FAP), IL-7 receptor, and transcription factor AP-2 gamma. The drug-gene interaction network analysis identified IL-6 among the most druggable targets. Of 6783 pharmaceutical agents, PI3K inhibitors and histone deacetylase blockers were the most effective in reversing the fibrotic signature via a FAP- and IL-6-dependent mechanism.ConclusionThis integrative approach identified potential anti-fibrotic compounds and molecular targets in CD-associated fibrostenosis, supporting future development of effective therapies.",

We aimed to evaluate the association between adherence to the MD and changes in fecal calprotectin (FC) levels among patients with CD in clinical and biochemical remission.MethodsA prospective cohort of patients with CD in clinical and biochemical remission [Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) ResultsA total of 96 patients were included in the analysis. Over time, adherence rate to the MD decreased by 25 % among those who were adherent at baseline and increased by 43.8 % among those who were non-adherent at baseline. Patients who were adherent at baseline had higher rates of deep remission at baseline compared with those who were non-adherent at baseline (96.2 % vs. 79.1 % respectively, p = 0.009), and higher rates of remission and deep remission at 3 months (97.5 % vs. 78.6 %, p = 0.011; and 87.5 % vs. 64.3 %, p = 0.023 respectively), but not at 6 months. Throughout follow-up, the change in FC levels was negatively correlated with the change in adherence to low intake of detrimental MD components (r = -0.340, p = 0.006), but not with high intake of beneficial components (p = 0.733).ConclusionAdherence to the MD was associated with lower FC levels at baseline and after 3 months. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of MD adherence on the maintenance of clinical and biochemical remission in CD.",

      "abstract": "PurposeThis study describes the use of upadacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, in combination with oral minoxidil for treatment of alopecia universalis (AU) with comorbid Crohn's disease (CD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). AU is the most extensive form of alopecia areata (AA), a chronic autoimmune condition that often requires systemic therapy for hair regrowth. While JAK inhibitors (JAKis) have demonstrated efficacy in each condition, data on upadacitinib's use in patients with coexisting disease are limited.Materials and methodsWe report the case of a 20-year-old male with CD who developed AU one year after initiating adalimumab. Following inadequate CD control and progression of hair loss, he was diagnosed with coexisting AU and AD. An IBD-directed regimen of upadacitinib (45 mg/day induction, 30 mg/day maintenance) was initiated with oral minoxidil, increased from 2.5 to 10 mg/day.ResultsBy 7 weeks, he experienced resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms and early hair regrowth; by 11 weeks, he achieved complete regrowth of scalp, eyebrow, eyelash, and beard hair. Colonoscopy confirmed histologic remission.ConclusionsThis case highlights the potential of JAK is to address potentially overlapping immune-mediated disorders and suggests that upadacitinib, in combination with oral minoxidil, may promote rapid AU remission. These findings may inform future treatment approaches for complex autoimmune presentations.",

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected. CTE was utilized to assess body composition. The control group consisted of children without inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) who underwent abdominal CT scans.ResultsA total of 68 children with CD (mean age 11.89 years) were included. The prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher in the CD group compared to the 136 controls (33.8% vs. 10.2%, P = 0.001). Body mass index (BMI) was identified as the only protective factor against sarcopenia (OR 0.734, 95% CI 0.578-0.932, P = 0.005). Among CD patients, those with loss of response (LOR) to IFX had a significantly higher incidence of sarcopenia than those in remission (50% vs. 23.8%, P = 0.027). After treatment with infliximab combined with total exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) or partial enteral nutrition (PEN) in 44 children, follow-up CTE showed a significant reduction in sarcopenia prevalence (47.7% vs. 25%, P = 0.027).ConclusionSarcopenia is common in Chinese children with CD and adversely affects the efficacy of biological therapy.

Currently, distinguishing between these diseases involves invasive procedures such as colonoscopy and histopathology. Fecal proteins, stable and in direct contact with inflammation, offer a noninvasive alternative. This study focuses on using high-throughput data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry and machine learning to develop an accurate biomarker signature from complex stool samples.MethodsStool samples obtained from 69 active patients were analyzed. Analysis of the stool proteome led to the identification and quantification of approximately 1,250 proteins. The samples were divided into training and testing groups. After data processing, various feature selection algorithms were applied on the training group to determine proteins that were significantly different between the CD and UC groups. In addition, 6 machine learning algorithms were evaluated to identify the best-performing classifiers.ResultsSixteen proteins were selected based on several feature selection algorithms, and 6 models were trained based on them. According to the performance metrics of each algorithm on the training data set, the Naive Bayes model was selected. For performance validation, the final predictive model was applied to 16 blind prospective samples as the test data set. Notably, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.96 on both the training and test data sets, highlighting its robustness and stability.DiscussionThis study demonstrates the potential of combining multiple stool protein biomarkers through high-throughput data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry and machine learning tools to develop a predictive model for efficiently distinguishing CD from UC.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough medical management has improved significantly, surgery plays an important role in the treatment of Crohn's disease. However, it is not curative, and recurrence - often occurring at or near the site of previous anastomosis - is common. To reduce postoperative recurrence, 2 surgical strategies have garnered increasing attention: the Kono-S anastomosis, which modifies anastomotic configuration, and extended mesenteric excision (EME), which targets the diseased mesentery thought to contribute to recurrence.MethodsThe theoretical basis and rationale of Kono-S anastomosis and EME were discussed, and a critical review of the current literature evaluating their efficacy was performed. Data were drawn from retrospective series, prospective cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with attention to the current state of evidence.ResultsEarly studies of the Kono-S anastomosis demonstrated impressively low rates of surgical recurrence. Data on its effect on endoscopic recurrence have varied but randomized data on surgical recurrence are pending. Similarly, retrospective analyses of EME suggested a reduced risk of recurrence, although results across recent studies have varied - potentially because of differences in operative technique or definitions of mesenteric excision.ConclusionHigh-quality data from several ongoing RCTs will help define the roles of the Kono-S anastomosis and EME in reducing recurrence rates for patients with Crohn's disease.",

Our aim was to compare all therapies for efficacy and safety in induction of remission.MethodsWe searched databases up to June 2025. Our outcomes were clinical remission and response, endoscopic remission, and safety outcomes. We performed network meta-analyses and estimated risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess certainty of results, and surface under the cumulative ranking curve for ranking treatments.ResultsA total of 79 RCTs with 20 724 participants were included. Interventions ranged from 2 to 30 weeks.

For endoscopic remission, there was moderate GRADE certainty of effectiveness for risankizumab (RR, 3.48; 95% CI, 2.18-5.58; RD = 17.4%, moderate magnitude). The certainty on safety varied, but treatments appear generally safe in the short term.ConclusionCombination of anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) and immunomodulators followed by anti-TNF monotherapy had large effect size with moderate certainty for the induction of clinical remission.

Inclusion criteria were, for group 1: active pCD in the 6 months before initiation of SC IFX; for group 2: inactive pCD for >6 months at the time of IV to SC switch. The primary end points were clinical remission at 6 months in group 1 and pCD relapse in group 2.ResultsOf the 183 patients included in 24 centers, 66 were in group 1 and 117 in group 2. The median follow-up was 50.4 (27.0-64.6) and 53.4 (40.6-67) weeks, respectively. In group 1 at 6 months, clinical remission was observed in 44.6% of patients and clinical response in 87.7%. Clinical remission including seton removal occurred in 35.5% of patients. In multivariable analysis, high body mass index was the only independent predictor of remission (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.99). In group 2, rates of relapse-free survival were 94.3% and 87.9% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Sixteen cases (8.3%) of adverse events related to SC injection were observed.DiscussionSC IFX was effective and safe for the treatment of active pCD and for maintaining remission after switching in this large multicenter cohort, thus supporting its use in routine practice in this indication.",

      "abstract": "Background: Endoscopic therapies for Crohn's disease (CD) strictures, including endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) and endoscopic stricturotomy (ESt), are less invasive interventions compared to surgery. ESt is advantageous for strictures that are longer, more fibrotic, or adjacent to anatomic structures requiring precision, and it has shown a high rate of surgery-free survival. Methods: We designed a microsimulation state-transition model comparing ESt to surgical resection for CD strictures. We calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year time horizon; secondary outcomes included costs (in 2022 USD) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We used a societal perspective to compare our strategies at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 100,000 USD/QALY. Sensitivity analyses, both deterministic and probabilistic, were performed. Results: The surgery strategy cost more than 2.5 times the ESt strategy, but resulted in nine more QALYs per 100 persons. The ICER for the surgery strategy was 308,787 USD/QALY; thus, the ESt strategy was determined more cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that quality of life after ESt as compared to that after surgery, the likelihood of repeat intervention, and surgical mortality and cost were the most influential parameters shifting cost-effectiveness. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses favored ESt in most (65.5%) iterations. Conclusions: Our study finds endoscopic stricturotomy to be a cost-effective strategy to manage primary or anastomotic Crohn's disease strictures. Post-intervention quality of life and probabilities of requiring repeated interventions exert most influence on cost-effectiveness. The decision between ESt and surgery should be made considering patient and stricture characteristics, preferences, and cost-effectiveness.",

Our study aims to determine the risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency in CD patients.MethodsBetween May 2021 and December 2023, we enrolled 102 CD patients and 100 healthy people in our hospital who were eligible for the study. Changes in vitamin D levels were also analyzed. CD patients were divided into active and clinical remission, and further changes in micronutrient and vitamin D levels were analyzed. Lastly, risk factor analysis was conducted using univariate, multivariate, and LASSO regression analysis models.ResultsThe average age of CD patients was 38.91 ± 3.31 years, whereas the average age of the healthy people was 38.64 ± 2.26 years. Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy controls (19.62 ± 2.68 vs. 22.68 ± 4.61), especially for patients with active CD. In 11 patients treated with vedolizumab, compared to the pre-treatment Vedolizumab group, vitamin D levels improved more dramatically post-Vedolizumab therapy. According to univariate analysis, Age (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.26-1.33, p=0.01), sex (OR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.25-0.99, p=0.03), recent biologics (OR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.44-1.25, p=0.02), iron (OR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.72-1.62, p=0.02), and total 25-OH vitamin D (OR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.99, p=0.02) did significantly differ between patients with and without vitamin D deficiency. After controlling for several variables, multivariate analysis revealed that a lower odds ratio was linked to increasing age at diagnosis (OR: 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.85, p=0.02), sex (OR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.95, p=0.01), iron (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.11-0.62, p=0.01), and 25-OH vitamin D total (OR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.95, p=0.03). In addition, Age, time since illness onset, and 25-OH vitamin D were found to be helpful indicators for CD patients using LASSO regression.ConclusionAccording to this study, vitamin D insufficiency was often linked to CD patients with active status and pre-treatment Vedolizumab. Furthermore, Age, time since illness onset, and 25-OH vitamin D were found to be significant risk factors for CD.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionRadiography is a crucial alternative in diagnosing small bowel pathologies due to the challenges of endoscopy. This review evaluates intussusception, Crohn's Disease, and small bowel adenocarcinoma to compare modalities across age groups and provide optimal imaging recommendations.MethodsA systematic search was performed in Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The review included studies from the past five years comparing modalities for the diagnosis of intussusception, Crohn's Disease, or small bowel adenocarcinoma. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was used for quality assessment. Data extraction was completed using a standardised template, and a thematic approach for narrative synthesis was performed.ResultsThirty-five studies were included, highlighting a higher diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound over radiography in pediatric intussusception. In adults, computed tomography (CT) was the only viable imaging modality, and adenocarcinoma was the most common malignant underlying cause of obstruction. Literature on adenocarcinoma was limited, with no analysis beyond standard cross-sectional modalities. In Crohn's Disease, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was considered advantageous for young people. CT techniques were emerging in terms of prominence for the monitoring of Crohn's Disease activity.ConclusionUltrasound is recommended for pediatric intussusception diagnosis, with radiographs favoured for predicting surgical outcomes. For Crohn's Disease, the optimal use of CT and MRI depends upon the phase of disease at the time of imaging. Given the late diagnosis of small bowel adenocarcinoma, further research into an optimised diagnostic pathway is necessary. Novel small bowel imaging techniques emerging in ultrasound, CT and MRI demonstrate potential diagnostic benefits for clinical use due to increased ability to differentiate between pathologies and reduced radiation doses.",

      "abstract": "Background: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that significantly affects patients' quality of life. Nutrition is increasingly recognized as a modifiable factor influencing disease activity and symptom management. Despite growing interest, structured dietary guidelines for CD are lacking, and patients often rely on personal experience or fragmented advice. This study aimed to investigate patients' perceptions of diet, the support they receive, and the psychosocial burden of dietary management in CD. Methods: A nationwide online survey was conducted in Italy from April to May 2025 among individuals diagnosed with CD. The questionnaire, developed in line with the CROSS reporting guidelines, comprised 30 multiple-choice questions across five sections: demographics, disease characteristics, dietary habits during remission, dietary habits during flare-ups, and psychological impact. Invitations were distributed through patient associations, webinars, and gastroenterology professionals. Responses were anonymized. Results: A total of 222 participants completed the survey (59.5% female, most aged 30-39 years). Fatigue was the most common symptom (71.6%), frequently persisting even during remission. Nearly half of respondents reported diet as \"very important\" in disease management, yet only 32% had received a formal referral to a nutritionist. The most commonly adopted dietary approach was a low-fiber diet, while awareness of evidence-based protocols like the Crohn's disease exclusion diet (CDED) was limited (11.7%). Social and psychological burdens were significant, with 79.2% reporting anxiety when outside their home. Conclusions: Dietary education and psychological support are unmet needs for CD patients. Improved access to tailored nutritional counseling and greater awareness of validated dietary approaches may enhance disease management and quality of life.",

We aimed to investigate the benefits of clearance monitoring for predicting endoscopic outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).MethodsData from patients with moderate-to-severe CD starting infliximab (n = 108) and ustekinumab (n = 80) therapy were repurposed. Endoscopic remission (CD Endoscopic Index of Severity 50% reduction in Simple Endoscopic Score for CD) was assessed at w24 of ustekinumab therapy. We performed Bayesian forecasting to estimate time-varying mAb clearance using drug concentrations, covariates, and in-house developed population pharmacokinetics models.ResultsPatients achieving endoscopic remission at w12 had significantly lower infliximab clearance and higher infliximab serum trough concentrations (Ctrough) at w2 of standard 5 mg/kg infliximab induction therapy, than patients without endoscopic remission (P trough (P = .92) than those without remission.

Ustekinumab clearance, but not Ctrough, was significantly different between endoscopic responders and nonresponders during standard ustekinumab induction and maintenance therapy (P ConclusionsAlthough Ctrough loses its ability to predict treatment response when doses are optimized or not administered by bodyweight, infliximab and ustekinumab clearance remains a reliable predictor for endoscopic outcomes.",

Kono-S is a novel anastomosis for ileocolonic resections; however, its altered configuration may challenge standard endoscopic assessment, particularly in the absence of validated scoring tools. This study evaluated the endoscopic assessment of Kono-S anastomosis anatomy and recurrence stratification using Rutgeert's score.MethodsThis retrospective study included colonoscopies performed on Crohn's disease patients with Kono-S anastomosis between March 2021 and 2025. Data included procedure dates, endoscopist subspecialty [inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) vs. non-IBD], and colonoscopy findings. Colonoscopies were rescored via Rutgeert's score and evaluated for completeness of assessment, defined as correct identification and photodocumentation of the anastomosis substructures. Factors associated with completeness were determined using Mann-Whitney U or Fisher's exact tests. Inter-rater reliability between endoscopists was calculated using Fleiss' kappa.ResultsForty-nine colonoscopies performed a median of 31 weeks postsurgery were included. Endoscopic recurrence (≥i2b) was 16.2% (median follow-up 153 weeks). Most procedures (89.5%) were performed by IBD subspecialists. Thorough assessments were achieved in 73.5% of colonoscopies, with IBD endoscopists significantly more likely to provide complete assessments (79.5%) compared with non-IBD endoscopists (20%, P = 0.014). Agreement with the rescored Rutgeerts occurred in 41 (93.2%) cases. Concordance with the central reading was high for IBD endoscopists (Fleiss' kappa: 0.897, P ConclusionWith increasing adoption of the Kono-S technique, this study suggests that IBD-specific endoscopy training is essential for accurate assessment of postoperative recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease.",

This study explored the role of PIV and SII in predicting treatment response and prognosis in CD patients receiving biologics.MethodsClinical data of 160 patients with CD were retrospectively collected from Anqing First People's Hospital in China. Patients were classified into effective and ineffective groups based on therapeutic response. Additionally, 60 healthy controls were enrolled. Serum levels of PIV and SII were measured in all participants. The effectiveness of infliximab was evaluated based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score ResultsThe effective group included 125 patients (mean age, 34.5 ± 10.2 years; 68 men [54.4%]), and the ineffective group included 35 patients (mean age, 36.1 ± 9.8 years; 18 men [51.4%]).

Compared with SII, PIV is a better choice. Key messages What is already known on this topic: Infliximab is the most efficacious and widely used biologic for inducing remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. SII and PIV have been validated as prognostic indicators in many diseases. What this study adds: Higher PIV and SII both have positive effects on predicting the prognosis of patients with Crohn's disease. Compared with the SII, the PIV holds greater significance in predicting the clinical outcomes for patients with Crohn's disease. How this study might affect research, practice or policy: PIV and SII may aid in risk stratification and individualized treatment planning in Crohn's disease.",

We conducted a new nationwide hospital-based survey to provide updated estimates of the patient numbers and prevalence rates of UC and CD in Japan in 2023.MethodsStratified random sampling was used to select hospital departments (internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and pediatric surgery) that routinely treat UC and CD patients. We sent questionnaires to the sampled departments to request sex-specific information on their patient numbers for UC and CD in 2023. Based on the responses, we estimated the annual patient numbers and prevalence rates of UC and CD throughout Japan. The estimates were compared with those from the previous 2015 survey.ResultsThe overall survey response rate was 50.8% (1,798/3,538 departments). The estimated patient numbers were approximately 316,900 (95% confidence interval: 223,900-409,900) for UC and 95,700 (61,100-130,400) for CD, both of which represent a 1.4-fold increase over the 8-year period since 2015. The annual prevalence rates per 100,000 population were 254.8 (male: 297.5; female: 214.4) for UC and 77.0 (male: 112.9, female: 43.0) for CD.

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone resistance (RTH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by diminished responsiveness of target tissues to thyroid hormones, primarily due to mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor-beta (TR-β) gene. This condition could lead to an increased level of Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and varying degrees of hypothyroid symptoms, despite normal or elevated levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Concurrently, Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease, poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its multifactorial etiology and association with various autoimmune disorders. This case report describes a 30-year-old female patient diagnosed with both RTH and CD. Given a history of thyroidectomy, the patient was on Levothyroxine supplement and also was taking corticosteroids for Crohn's disease. Despite adherence to therapy, persistently elevated TSH levels were noted, and the patient still exhibited signs of hypothyroidism. Altogether, it raised suspicions for RTH. After 1 year, we successfully managed her Crohn's disease, achieving sustained remission. Surprisingly, clinical and biochemical markers of hypothyroidism also showed significant improvement. This case illustrates the intricate relationship between autoimmune conditions and thyroid dysfunction, emphasizing the necessity for comprehensive evaluation in patients with overlapping symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of recognizing RTH in patients with unexplained thyroid abnormalities, particularly in the context of coexisting inflammatory bowel diseases, to optimize management and improve patient outcomes.",

This study aimed to evaluate short-term outcomes and identify factors associated with major complications following laparoscopic ileocecal resection in patients with complex CD.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on patients with complex CD who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection. Patients with prior intestinal surgery for CD were excluded to ensure a uniform cohort. Short-term outcomes, including operative time, blood loss, complications, and hospital stay, were compared between patients undergoing laparoscopic (LS) and open surgery (OS). Univariate analysis was performed to assess factors associated with major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3).ResultsA total of 101 patients were included (LS, n=21; OS, n=80). The LS group had significantly lower blood loss (140 vs. 222.5 mL, P=0.048) and shorter postoperative hospitalization (12 vs. 15 days, P=0.0068). No conversions to open surgery were required. There was no significant difference in the incidence of major complications (9.5% vs. 3.8%, P=0.57). Major complications occurred in 4.8% of cases overall.

Our goal was to identify the key molecules and pathways involved in their coexistence.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive quantitative bioinformatic analysis utilizing publicly accessible RNA sequencing datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, specifically the datasets GSE186582 for Crohn's Disease (CD) and GSE164760 for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the R packages \"edgeR\" and \"limma.\" Functional characterization of these DEGs was performed through gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Protein-protein interaction networks of the DEGs were constructed using STRING and visualized with Cytoscape, with key hub genes identified via the cytoHubba plugin. To validate these hub genes, we employed independent datasets, GSE20881 for CD and GSE63067 for NASH.ResultsIn total, 104 common DEGs were identified, with 62 being downregulated and 42 upregulated. Both CD and NASH showed enhanced amino acid production and metabolism. Notably, ten hub genes-GLUL, COL3A1, CTH, PDGFRA, GOT1, PECAM1, FCER1G, NOTCH2, PC, and ASPA-emerged as central players. ROC analysis pinpointed GLUL as a significant hub gene, displaying an area under the curve of > 0.8 for both CD and NASH; this was further validated by RT-qPCR. Additionally, the transcription factors SRF and YY1, predicted by this hub gene, showed marked differential expression in both NASH and CD.ConclusionCollectively, our findings shed light on a potential shared pathogenesis between NASH and CD, with the hub gene GLUL offering promising diagnostic and therapeutic insights.",

The assays targeted the Microbial Anti-inflammatory Molecule (MAM) genes, which encode MAM proteins. These assays demonstrated 100% species-specificity using strains from six Faecalibacterium species: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Faecalibacterium taiwanense, Faecalibacterium duncaniae, Faecalibacterium longum, Faecalibacterium hattori, and Faecalibacterium CNCM4541. They also showed high sensitivity with detection limits of 10^5 bacteria per gram of sample. In healthy individuals, the different Faecalibacterium species varied in abundance. F. taiwanense, F. duncaniae, and F. longum were the most prevalent, around 10^10 bacteria/g of stool. In contrast, F. hattori and CNCM4541 were less abundant, with 10^7 bacteria/g. Despite its low abundance, F. hattori was present in all healthy subjects, while CNCM4541 was detected in only 50% of them. Notably, F. taiwanense, F. duncaniae, and F. longum were found in all healthy individuals. In Crohn's disease patients, both in flare and remission, a decrease in Faecalibacterium species was observed, with no recovery in remission. The most abundant species in Crohn's disease patients were F. prausnitzii and F. duncaniae, around 10^7 bacteria/g, while F. longum, F. hattori, and F. taiwanense were present at lower levels (10^6 bacteria/g), and CNCM4541 was no longer detected. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii showed a smaller decrease in abundance compared with other species. Moreover, F. prausnitzii was significantly more prevalent in patients in remission than in those in flare, suggesting that it may be more resistant to inflammation.

Due to its incurability and recurring nature, CD patients often experience psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. The potential link and molecular mechanisms between these psychological issues and disease progression remain unclear. Recent evidence highlights the gut-brain axis as a key factor in CD pathogenesis, but the bidirectional regulatory mechanisms between psychological comorbidities and intestinal inflammation need further study. With the rapid development of multimodal Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, significant progress has been made in their application in CD-related neurobiological research. Many studies have found significant structural and functional changes in specific brain regions of CD patients, including reduced gray matter volume (GMV), abnormal functional connectivity (FC), and altered brain metabolism. Of these, alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and insula are highly reproducible across different MRI modalities. These findings reveal the potential profound impact of CD-related psychological comorbidities on the brain. This review, based on the regulatory mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, summarizes the latest applications of MRI technologies in CD involving psychological comorbidities and discusses emerging research directions.

There remains a need to develop guidance that may be for both clinical trials and clinical practice. This initiative aimed to develop consensus statements for definitions of response and remission, transmural healing, optimal timing for assessing, and evaluation of treatment efficacy in patients with Crohn's disease using magnetic resonance enterography in clinical trials and clinical practice.MethodsThirty-three international experts (gastroenterologists [n = 29] and radiologists [n = 4] participated in a consensus process. A systematic literature review was conducted to inform initial consensus, and statements were discussed and voted on using a modified Delphi method. Consensus was defined as at least 75% agreement among voters.ResultsThe Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) score and the simplified MaRIA score should be used to determine response and remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Response was defined as a MaRIA score ConclusionsA consensus expert panel has developed standardized definitions of magnetic resonance enterography response, remission, and the optimal timing for response assessment in patients with luminal Crohn's disease. Further research is needed to clarify the method for measuring transmural healing.",

      "abstract": "A 57-year-old woman with a history of polytrauma due to a car accident in March 2023 presented to de Emergency Room one month after this episode with subocclusive symptoms. CT scan revealed a 10cm proximal ileum segment as the reason of the subocclusion. This segment presented wall thickening, vascular engorgement, and inflammatory changes in the surrounding fat. The patient was admitted to the Surgical Department for conservative treatment, and after several days with no amelioration, intravenous corticosteroids were initiated with clinical improvement, patient was discharged on oral corticosteroids and referred to the Gastroenterology Clinic with a suspicion of Crohn's disease. However, the patient suffered two more subocclusive episodes improving with corticosteroids. After multidisciplinary discussion infliximab was finally initiated for Crohn's disease. In the weeks after this no more visits to the Emergency Room happened, but the patient continued with chronic subocclusive symptoms and weight loss. Due to diagnostic doubts and infliximab failure, surgical resection was decided. In November 2023 a 15cm medium ileal stenosis was resected. The segment was affected with both acute and chronic inflammation, mucosal ulceration covered with granulation tissue, villous atrophy, haemorrhage in the lamina propria, and architectural distortion. Final diagnosis was post-traumatic ileal stenosis. Eighteen months later no signs of recurrence have been appreciated. Small bowel obstruction after blunt abdominal trauma is a rare complication that manifests one week to several months or years after the trauma. There are no specific findings, but a prior history of blunt abdominal trauma with no previous obstructive symptoms must raise suspicion on this entity. Ulcers, transmural inflammation, fibromusculosis, and neovascularity in the submucosa, as well as siderophages and foreign body reaction in the subserosa can be found in the histopathological examination. It has been hypothesized that it maybe secondary to an inflammatory response to a localized intestinal perforation, or injury to the mesentery (whether it is localized haemorrhage, a rent in the mesentery, thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels) that leads to intestinal stenosis due to ischemic changes. It may be related to a strong compression of the intestine and its mesentery between the seatbelt and the spinal column. Treatment for this condition is resecting the stenosis.",

However, the impact of PAHs on the inflammatory activity of Crohn's disease (CD) and the potential mechanism remain unclear. We explored the relationship between PAH exposure and disease activity in CD patients and evaluated the underlying mediating role of oxidative stress.MethodsA total of 127 adult CD patients at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, were included in this study. Ten urinary monohydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs), two urinary oxidative stress biomarkers [8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α)], and four CD activity indices [Crohn's disease Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), body mass index (BMI), simplified endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD), and computed tomography enterography score (CTE)] were assessed. After adjusting for possible confounders, multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of urinary OH-PAHs with CD activity and oxidative stress, and oxidative stress with CD activity. Mediation analyses were conducted to estimate the mediating role of oxidative stress in the relationship between urinary OH-PAHs and CD activity.ResultsWith a doubling increase in certain urinary OH-PAHs, HBI increased (3-OHPh 13.0% [3.1%, 23.7%], 4-OHPh 16.2% [5.4%, 28.3%], and 2-OHFlu 10.6% [0.2%, 22.1%]) while BMI decreased (3-OHPh 3.4% [-5.8%, -1.0%], 4-OHPh 5.1% [-7.5%, -2.6%], 9-OHPh 3.3% [-5.7%, -1.0%], 2-OHFlu 3.4% [-5.9%, -0.8%], 1-OHP 1.2% [-2.1%, -0.2%], ΣOHPh 3.1% [-5.8%, -0.4%], ΣOHFlu 3.3% [-6.3%, -0.3%], and ΣOH-PAHs 2.7% [-5.3%, -0.1%]) in CD patients in an exposure-response manner. Meanwhile, almost all urinary OH-PAHs were dose-dependently associated with elevated urinary 8-OHdG and 8-iso-PGF2α, both of which were also associated with the increased HBI and decreased BMI. Further mediation analyses showed that the oxidative stress mediated 61.9-91.8% of the associations of urinary OH-PAHs with HBI and BMI.ConclusionPAH exposure results in enhanced disease activity in CD patients.

To date, no curative treatment for this disease exists, highlighting the need to develop new therapies targeting the origin of the inflammation, in particular the intestinal microbiota and more specifically AIEC. This study investigated the anti-virulence properties of 17 bacterial strains (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and three plant extracts (walnut and green tea leaves and liquorice roots) against AIEC. In vitro, six lactobacilli strains and one bifidobacterium strain reduced AIEC LF82 adhesion to Caco-2/TC7 cells and/or suppressed IL-8 secretion induced by AIEC. Although plant extracts did not prevent adhesion or inflammation, they inhibited AIEC growth. In a murine model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis exacerbated by LF82 infection, two Lacticaseibacillus strains, one Bifidobacterium strain, and walnut and green tea extracts efficiently alleviated colitis and reduced faecal lipocalin-2 levels. For the green tea extract and one Lacticaseibacillus strain, beneficial effects were correlated with a decreased number of AIEC associated with the colonic mucosa. Building on these findings, bacteria and plant extract combinations were tested in the same model. A formulation combining two Lacticaseibacillus strains (Lbs. casei and Lbs. rhamnosus) with the walnut extract demonstrated the greatest efficacy, markedly reducing colitis score and preserving intestinal mucosa integrity. While untreated mice remained heavily colonised, the combination promoted AIEC elimination from the gut of half the mice, contributing to the alleviation of colitis symptoms. These results highlight the ability of combinations of specific bacteria/plant extracts to limit the presence of AIEC in the ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, presenting a promising approach for disease management.",

Histology in the resection specimen was assessed in location-matched tissue sections. Following a consensus session, 2 pathologists blindly assessed the predominant phenotype (inflammatory [IP], chronic [CP], or mixed [MP]) in the strictures. The primary objective of the study was to find a parameter to identify strictures with IP.ResultsA total of 36 patients were included (IP, 7 [20%]; CP, 16 [44%]; MP, 13 [36%]). Univariate analysis showed a positive association with an IP for loss of wall layer stratification (WLS) (odds ratio [OR], 7.86; P = .029) and higher contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) parameters. Bowel wall thickness (5.74 vs 7.46 mm; P = .002) was lower and color Doppler signal (OR, 0.14; P = .03) and loss of WLS (OR, 0.14; P = .027) were less present in CP. In multivariate analysis, loss of WLS and wash-in area under the curve at CEUS indicated an IP, whereas lower bowel wall thickness and color Doppler signal ≤2 indicated a CP. With these parameters, the Stricture Score Amsterdam was constructed and demonstrated accuracy for IP (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.88; P = .002) and CP (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.90; P ConclusionA combination of IUS and CEUS is accurate to differentiate between inflammatory and chronic strictures in CD.

G protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84) is emerging as a potential target for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Pharmacological investigations confirm the efficacy of PCL against IBD, but its active components targeting GPR84 and their mechanisms remain unclear.Aim of the studyWe aimed to identify active components from PCL against GPR84, evaluate their therapeutic effects and elucidate their mechanisms of action in IBD treatment.Materials and methodsThe GPR84 screening model was established using dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assays, with isobavachalcone identified as an antagonist. Its activity was confirmed by fluorescence imaging plate reader and cellular thermal shift assays. The binding interactions were analyzed through DMR co-stimulation assay, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The efficacy of isobavachalcone was assessed in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced Crohn's disease-like colitis mice model. RNA sequencing, siRNA knockdown and western blotting were used to elucidate its molecular mechanism.ResultsIsobavachalcone was identified as a selective GPR84 antagonist. It stably bound to GPR84 via π-cation, π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. In vitro, isobavachalcone demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity. In vivo, isobavachalcone markedly alleviated body weight loss, colonic shortening, colonic damage and macrophage infiltration. Moreover, isobavachalcone protected intestinal barrier integrity and inhibited proinflammatory cytokines, especially macrophage-produced Tnf-α, Il-6, Il-1α/β and Il-23. Mechanistically, isobavachalcone inhibited the GPR84-PI3K-AKT axis.ConclusionsThis study reveals the underlying mechanisms of PCL and identifies isobavachalcone as a potential candidate for Crohn's disease treatment, providing scientific basis for its clinical efficacy.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionSide-to-side stapled ileocolonic anastomosis (ICA) is commonly used in Crohn's disease (CD). Antiperistaltic ICA (APICA) and isoperistaltic ICA (IPICA) alignments differ in ease of neo-terminal ileum (neo-TI) intubation, potentially impacting endoscopic follow-up. This study compares postsurgical neo-TI intubation feasibility between APICA and IPICA.Materials and methodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of CD patients (≥18 y) who underwent ileocolonic resection between 2010 and 2022 and completed ileocolonoscopy within 24 mo. Patients with non-APICA/IPICA anastomoses, ileostomy, and patients whose ileocolonoscopy report was unavailable were excluded.ResultsWe included 148 patients, (76.4% APICA and 23.6% IPICA). Groups were comparable in demographics, surgical factors, and postsurgical outcomes. Anastomotic disease recurrence (Rutgeerts score Ri ≥ 2b) was similar: 37.6% APICA versus 37.1% IPICA (P = 0.563). Excluding patients with anastomotic strictures and poor preparation, neo-TI intubation was successful in 87.4% of APICA versus 100% of IPICA (P = 0.038).ConclusionsAPICA and IPICA have similar safety and endoscopic recurrence rates. IPICA allows for easier neo-TI intubation with no intubation failure, improving endoscopic surveillance and management of CD.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundWe aimed to elucidate the function of the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 in intestinal fibrosis, which is invariably associated with Crohn's disease (CD) and often results in strictures and obstructions, requiring surgical intervention. Notably, PIEZO1 is strongly expressed in fibrotic tissues and linked with fibrotic progression.MethodsIntestinal tissues were procured from 28 patients diagnosed with CD and 8 healthy control subjects. Histological and immunofluorescence assays verified that PIEZO1 is substantially overexpressed in fibrotic intestinal tissues and is involved in epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further gene knockout experiments and transcriptome sequencing elucidated the specific role of PIEZO1 in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis in CD. We generated mice with Piezo1 deletion specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (Piezo1f/fVilcre) to validate in vivo that inhibiting Piezo1 function attenuates or reverses intestinal fibrosis associated with CD.ResultsPIEZO1 expression was strongly increased in the fibrotic small intestine of CD patients, thereby promoting EMT and exacerbating intestinal fibrosis. In vivo investigations revealed that the conditional suppression of Piezo1 in intestinal epithelial cells significantly mitigated intestinal fibrosis in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced chronic colitis model mice. In vitro examinations revealed that Piezo1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells preserved the stability of HIF-1α, induced EMT to stimulate the expression of fibrosis-associated molecules, and promoted fibrosis.ConclusionPIEZO1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of intestinal fibrosis by maintaining the levels of HIF-1α, thereby promoting EMT. Therapeutic strategies targeting PIEZO1 could be used to prevent intestinal fibrosis in CD patients.",

This study investigates whether postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with endoscopic recurrence (ER) after ICR.MethodsAll CD patients who underwent ICR between 2007 and 2022 at two referral centers were identified from prospectively maintained databases. Those with endoscopic follow-up within 12 months postoperatively were included. ER was defined as modified Rutgeerts score (mRs) ≥i2b. The primary outcome was the association between postoperative CRP levels and ER. Secondary outcomes were the added prognostic value of postoperative CRP levels for predicting ER, adjusted for traditional risk factors.ResultsAmong 542 patients, 36% had penetrating disease, 24% were active smokers, and 11% received prophylactic advanced therapies. ER was observed in 243/542 (45%). Patients with ER had higher CRP levels on postoperative day (POD) 2-5, with a significant difference on POD 4 (median CRP, 122 mg/L vs 97 mg/L; adjusted mean difference, 16% [1 to 26%]). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, CRP levels on POD 4 remained an independent predictor of ER (p = 0.022) and improved the AUC of a model with traditional risk factors by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02-0.09; p = 0.0005).ConclusionElevated CRP levels on POD 4 in CD patients undergoing ICR were associated with an increased risk of ER within 12 months. In combination with other known risk factors, CRP could serve as a marker to identify patients benefitting from closer postoperative monitoring.",

HAE most often presents within the first two decades of life and may cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and emesis, making it an important diagnosis for pediatric gastroenterologists to consider. Here, we report the case of an 11-year-old boy with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with recurrent episodes of acute epigastric and periumbilical pain despite evidence of endoscopic, histologic, and radiographic remission. These pain episodes lasted 12-48 h, were associated with nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, and prompted several visits to the emergency department. Abdominal exam and imaging were repeatedly unremarkable, and bloodwork was notable only for mildly elevated C-reactive protein (<10 mg/L). Eventually, the patient presented with acute facial edema and was referred to Immunology for workup of suspected HAE. Bloodwork revealed low C4 and C1INH concentration, confirming the diagnosis of HAE type I, and the patient was started on appropriate pharmacotherapy to good effect. This case highlights the importance of investigating alternative diagnoses in patients with adequately treated inflammatory bowel disease who continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms and exemplifies common gastrointestinal manifestations of HAE.",

      "abstract": "Background and aimsCrohn's disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition with inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology of CD is complex with underlying mechanisms only partially elucidated. Retrotransposons, a category of transposable elements within a genome, have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. This research aimed to explore the expression of retrotransposons in children with CD.MethodsTo assess the expression level of retrotransposons, high-throughput expression analysis at the locus level was performed including LINE, SINE, and LTR-retrotransposons (human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)) in total RNAseq of ileal and rectal biopsies from treatment-naïve children with CD and age-matched non-Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) controls (CMU-dataset). Findings were validated in public datasets (GSE57945 Ileal; GSE117993 Rectal) from the pediatric RISK study.ResultsConsistent separation of retrotransposon expression between CD and non-IBD controls in both the CMU-dataset and the RISK-dataset was observed in ileal biopsies, but less so in rectal biopsies. In total, 118 differentially expressed retrotransposon loci were identified (27 upregulated and 91 downregulated; 74 LINE-1 and 44 HERV) in CMU-ileal dataset. Fifteen retrotransposon loci were consistently downregulated in both datasets (CMU-ileal and GSE57945): HERV9N-int, HERV9-int (2 loci), HERVH-int (2 loci), HERVK22-int, LTR5A, HERVK-int, L1PA4 (5 loci), L1PA6, L1PA14.ConclusionsRetrotransposon transcriptome in children with CD significantly differed from non-IBD controls in ileal biopsies with 15 retrotransposon loci consistently downregulated in CD. The possible regulatory function of these retrotransposon loci merits additional research. This study may provide valuable perspectives for the advancement of novel therapeutic strategies.",

However, it's additional value next to conventional markers of disease activity has not been studied in paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). This study aimed to assess the clinical added value of POCUS in children with CD.MethodsConsecutive children with CD visiting the outpatient clinic were prospectively enrolled and underwent POCUS in addition to faecal calprotectin (FC) test and mucosal inflammation noninvasive index for paediatric Crohn's disease (MINI-index) assessment. Both tests were categorised into normal, uncertain and abnormal. Paediatric gastroenterologists decided on clinical management before and after POCUS disclosure. Predictive value of POCUS for clinical flares within 4 months was assessed. Outcomes were the proportion (95% CI) of patients where POCUS result was discordant from FC and MINI-index, proportion of patients where POCUS changed clinical management, and predictive values of POCUS for clinical disease flares.ResultsWe included 76 patients (median age: 16 years, 34 (45%) female, median disease duration: 2 years). In 7 (9% (4%-18%)), and 2 (3% (0%-9%)) patients, the POCUS resulted in a less severe classification and in 43 (57% (45%-70%)), and 44 (58% (46%-69%)), in a more severe classification of disease severity compared to FC and MINI-index, respectively. Clinical management was adjusted in 46 (58%) cases after POCUS result disclosure. The positive and negative predictive value for clinical flares within 4 months of an abnormal POCUS were 71 (57%-82)% and 74 (64%-83)%, respectively.ConclusionsPOCUS seems a valuable noninvasive monitoring tool for children with CD. Our results support the application of POCUS in the clinical management of these children.",

We assessed whether a 2-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) followed by CDED+PEN is superior to 8 weeks of EEN in sustaining clinical remission at week 14 in mild-to-severe CD and if CDED+PEN can maintain remission to week 24.MethodsThis international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial compared 2 weeks of EEN (Modulen IBD) followed by 3 phases of the CDED+PEN (henceforth CDED) to 8 weeks of EEN, followed by PEN with free diet up to week 24 (henceforth EEN).ResultsOut of 64 eligible patients, 56 were randomized (target recruitment failed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an underpowered study): 30 patients to CDED and 26 to EEN. The primary endpoint at week 14 showed no significant difference between the groups, with sustained corticosteroid-free remission in 21 (70%) of 30 for CDED compared with 16 (61.5%) of 26 for EEN (P = .5). At week 8, clinical remission was achieved in 23 (77%) of 30 CDED patients vs 14 (54%) of 26 EEN patients (P = .07), and 18 (60%) of 30 CDED patients vs 11 (42%) of 26 EEN patients maintained clinical remission to week 24 (P = .18).

A man in his 40s had a 28-year history of Crohn's disease with perianal involvement for over 20 years. He visited our hospital due to worsening anal pain and fecal incontinence. Following clinical evaluation, he was diagnosed with anal canal cancer and subsequently underwent surgery. Histopathological examination revealed cancer originating from the chronically inflamed mucosa, suggesting p53-positive dysplasia, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and subsequently, mucinous adenocarcinoma. The final diagnosis was Crohn's-disease-associated anal canal cancer. Despite postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, he exhibited pelvic recurrence and distant metastasis 20 months postoperatively. A comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment intervention was implemented; however, he eventually succumbed to cancer progression 3 years after surgery.

      "abstract": "Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in Crohn's disease (CD). We completed a pilot study using novel reverse-engineered EEN (RE-EEN), a whole food smoothie in place of commercial liquid formula (EEN) which contains food additives to improve shelf stability and palatability. In a four week trial with RE-EEN, we reported 80 % of patients went into clinical remission after four weeks. We hypothesized RE-EEN would decrease environmental toxin exposure through reduction of processing food intake. Biosamples were collected at baseline and at weeks two, four, and eight during the RE-EEN study. Urinary heavy metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and urinary phthalate metabolites and melamine by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. For our primary analysis, change in baseline was calculated using a paired t-test for week four. Analysis was also completed for all weeks on RE-EEN using a generalized least squares model. Results were expressed as fold change ± standard error mean. Paired t-testing demonstrated a statistically significant (p < 0.05) effect on molybdenum (Mo) with a fold change of 0.17 ± 0.15, an 83 % reduction following RE-EEN treatment. Our results suggested an effect of arsenic (As) with fold change of 0.23 ± 0.26 (p = 0.12), a 77 % reduction following RE-EEN treatment. Our results also suggested an effect of cobalt (Co) with a fold change of 3.12 ± 3.12 fold, a 212 % increase following RE-EEN therapy (p = 0.16). With inclusion of all weeks on RE-EEN, Mo and As were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Overall, we observed favorable shifts in urinary heavy metals by week four, and no effects were suggested in phthalate and melamine analysis. We saw increased precision in a sensitivity analysis when including all weeks for treatment. This is the first study to examine environmental toxicants in relation to whole foods smoothie diet in pediatric CD. RE-EEN dietary intervention shows promise in reducing chemical exposures and may contribute to CD remission. Notable limitations to this research include small sample size and absence of a control group. Further studies are necessary to assess the impact of RE-EEN diet on environmental toxicant exposure.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) causes gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., diarrhea and abdominal pain), systemic symptoms (i.e., fatigue, anemia, weight loss, and fever), and perianal fistulas that produce anal pain. Because of the frequent occurrence of diarrhea and ulcers in the rectum, CD is often exacerbated by perianal abscesses and/or fistulas. Perianal fistulizing CD (PFCD) has an unknown etiology and recurring symptoms such as pain and discharge, which seriously affects the patient's quality of life (QOL). In the past, radical surgery was performed for PFCD, but due to the risk of anal sphincter impairment, conservative therapy using antibiotics and immunosuppressive medications is currently the first treatment option. PFCD management has greatly improved with the use of biologics such as the antitumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antibodies infliximab and adalimumab. In this review, the results of the administration of anti-TNF-α (certolizumab pegol), anti-interleukin-12/23 (ustekinumab), and anti-α4β7 integrin antibodies (vedolizumab) were evaluated. Our investigation showed that these medications may be effective for maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of anal fistulas. In addition to biologics, molecular target drugs and even regenerative medicine using mesenchymal stem cells have been introduced to further expand the treatment options for consideration by medical personnel. We herein discuss the management of PFCD by focusing on studies conducted in the United States and Europe where researchers used recommended guidelines and consensus statements to evaluate the efficacy of each medication and published their findings in peer-reviewed journals.",

Among these, 54 patients (36%) required post-operative biologic therapy. Seventy-three patients were treated with biologics first, of which 29 (40%) subsequently required a surgical resection (p = 0.60). There were 95 patients (43%) who were successfully treated with a surgery-first approach alone. Median follow-up was 73 months (0-406). Characteristics associated on multivariable analysis with change from surgery to biologics were: gender (female) (p = 0.010), presence of obstructive symptoms (p = 0.028), and smoking (p = 0.030). Characteristics associated with changing from biologics to surgery were: isolated terminal ileum disease (p = 0.001) and the presence of obstructive symptoms (p = 0.003).ConclusionsIn our cohort, the risk of recurrent ileocolic Crohn's disease was similar whether patients were treated with a 'surgery first' or 'biologic first' approach.",

Infliximab (IFX) can rapidly relieve CD-related symptoms and promote mucosal healing. However, some patients may occur secondary loss of response (SLOR) during the maintenance treatment, leading to the recurrence or progression of CD. The current IFX efficacy prediction models for CD have limited applicability to SLOR. Radiomics, as a non-invasive technique, is expected to serve as a more accurate tool for predicting the risk of SLOR.AimTo develop a radiomics-based model via integrative analysis of intestinal wall and creeping fat to predict SLOR in CD.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from 220 CD patients in two centers. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to screen out clinically independent predictors of SLOR. Radiomics features of the intestinal wall and creeping fat were extracted and fused together for analysis. Univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses were used to select the most valuable radiomics features to calculate Radscore and develop radiomics predictive model. A combined predictive model was developed based on the Radscore and clinically independent predictors through multivariate logistic regression analysis. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve and the decision curve analysis were used to verify model performance.ResultsWhite blood cell count, disease duration and Harvey-Bradshaw Index were identified as clinically independent predictors of SLOR to develop the clinical model. Fifteen most valuable radiomics features were selected to develop the radiomics model. Compared with the clinical and radiomics models, the combined model achieved the best prediction performance, with AUCs were 0.871 (95%CI: 0.814-0.929) in the training cohort and 0.854 (95%CI: 0.759-0.949) in the validation cohort.ConclusionThe combined model that integrates intestinal wall and creeping fat analysis is valuable for predicting the SLOR of IFX in CD.",

COs reflected disease progression, including surgery, hospitalizations, new fistulas, abscesses, strictures, and treatment escalation.MethodsThe DIRECT study was a multicenter, prospective investigation (2016-2019), including moderate-severe CD patients on IFX. Latent class mixed models were used to identify subgroups based on longitudinal FCAL and CRP trajectories.ResultsFCAL trajectory analysis identified four clusters; CRP analysis revealed three. Patients in the U-shaped FCAL trajectory (Class 1) were more likely to achieve the global CO [odds ratio (OR) 3.263, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.050-10.144, P = .041] and the CO without symptoms and IFX adjustments compared to those in the subthreshold decline (Class 4) (OR 9.639, 95% CI 1.147-81.025, P = .037). In CRP trajectories, patients in the upward trend (Class C) had a higher odds of achieving the global CO compared to the flat trajectory (Class B) (OR 2.171, 95% CI 1.059-4.449, P = .034). In multivariable regression models, class membership improved composite outcome discrimination.ConclusionsPatients under IFX therapy with near or above-threshold FCAL levels or a history of high CRP were more likely to experience adverse outcomes. Regression analyses demonstrated that class membership provided additional prognostic value beyond baseline variables alone.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Inflammatory bowel disease is commonly associated with recurrent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, with or without systemic involvement. Here, we report a very rare presentation of inflammatory bowel disease with pneumomediastinum, which is important for healthcare workers to be aware of because pneumomediastinum can present with rapid symptoms onset. Previous reported cases were mainly noted after long-term steroids use or scope-induced perforation. CASE REPORT We present a case a 23-year-old woman with a 14-day history of constipation followed by diarrhea (sometimes bloody), with vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. She was initially managed as having acute gastroenteritis, but due to persist unexplained tachycardia, a chest CT was done, which incidentally showed a pneumomediastinum along with pulmonary embolism. The patient deteriorated significantly on the same day of chest imaging and developed severe lactic acidosis with hypoglycemia and severe hepatic injury. After extensive assessment by imaging and scopes for biopsy, she was diagnosed with fulminant Crohn's disease, causing severe liver injury, colitis, and pneumomediastinum. She improved significantly with steroids and was discharged home. On follow-up, immunosuppressive agents were initiated. CONCLUSIONS Pneumomediastinum is a rare manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, which could be reflective of severe colitis and should be considered in patients presenting with chest symptoms regardless of procedure, scope exposure, or long-term steroids use. Attention to early instability signs like tachycardia and tachypnea can help reveal early complications.",

Despite advancements in treatments, pfCD remains challenging to manage with low healing rates. Fecal diversion (FD) has previously demonstrated clinical improvement for patients with refractory disease. Our meta-analysis aimed to explore the clinical response to FD, rates of successful restoration of bowel continuity after FD, rates of re-diversion, and factors affecting the success of FD in pfCD.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out of adult patients who had undergone FD for pfCD, with detailed patient outcome data. Studies were identified through a literature search of six bibliographic databases and one trial register, all run on February 28, 2025, including MEDLINE ALL, EMBASE, Emcare, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov.ResultsSeventeen studies encompassing 714 adult pfCD patients were included. FD resulted in a 65% clinical improvement rate, yet considerable heterogeneity existed in study methodologies and outcome definitions. While 29% of patients achieved bowel restoration within a median follow-up of 58.2 months, challenges in sustaining the effects were evident, with 10% requiring repeat diversion and a 37% overall proctectomy/proctocolectomy rate. Factors associated with diversion success included the absence of rectal involvement and quiescent luminal disease, with biologic use showing no impact on outcomes.ConclusionsFD offers symptom control in pfCD, although restoration rates remain low. These findings emphasize the need for individualized patient counseling. Future research should strive for uniform measures and refined approaches to enhance pfCD management.",

Despite extensive research on bacterial dysbiosis in IBD, the role of the gut mycobiome remains largely unexplored, particularly in surgical tissue specimens.MethodsIn this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the intestinal fungal communities in surgical resections obtained from 20 patients with UC and 30 patients with CD, with non-IBD resections serving as controls. Fungal DNA was extracted and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified and sequenced using high-throughput Illumina technology. RNA from surgical resections from both non-IBD and IBD patients was obtained and the expression of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic genes was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.ResultsBioinformatic analysis revealed modest changes in fungal diversity in UC resections compared with those from controls. However, CD specimens exhibited significant alterations in mycobiome composition, including an increased abundance of Malassezia, specifically Malassezia globose, alongside a reduction in Yarrowia lipolytica. Moreover, stratification of CD into complicated phenotypes (B2 stricturing vs B3 penetrating) identified distinct fungal signatures capable of discriminating between these clinical phenotypes. Correlation analyses revealed a direct association between the mycobiome and intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, in parallel with several interactions between fungal and bacterial species, further reporting interkingdom interactions between both microbial communities.ConclusionsThese results underscore the potential of fungal biomarkers in elucidating IBD pathogenesis and its associated complications, which opens up promising avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies.",

More than 90% of patients with Crohn's disease have a concomitant diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea following an ileal resection. This pilot study aimed to assess whether the use of bile acid sequestrants in patients with Crohn's disease who have undergone a primary terminal ileal resection with concomitant bile acid diarrhea can alter the microbiome and prevent disease recurrence.MethodsPatients with Crohn's disease who underwent a primary terminal ileal resection and had symptoms of diarrhea within 1-3 months of surgery underwent 75SeHCAT testing for bile acid diarrhea. If positive (75SeHCAT ≤ 15%), patients were treated with colesevelam and stool samples were collected at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6-12 months posttreatment. If negative (75SeHCAT > 15%), treatment was not given and were reviewed in the clinic as per local guidelines. All patients underwent a 6-12 month postoperative colonoscopy where further stool samples and mucosal biopsies were taken. Disease activity was established using the endoscopic Rutgeert's score, with disease remission defined as Rutgeert's score ResultsA total of 14 patients who completed the study, 10 of whom had a 75SeHCAT positive diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea and were started on treatment with colesevelam. Four patients did not require treatment as 3 were asymptomatic and 1 had a negative 75SeHCAT scan. Three of the fourteen patients had disease recurrence at their 6-12 month postoperative colonoscopy assessment, of which 1 patient was taking colesevelam and 2 patients were not taking colesevelam. A total of 44 fecal samples and 44 mucosal biopsies underwent 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis to assess α/β-diversity and microbial composition. In the colesevelam treated patients there was no significant difference in α/β-diversity pre- and posttreatment. Pretreatment, the 3 most abundant bacterial classes in all patients were Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Gammaproteobacteria. Following 6-12 months of treatment, out of the 9 patients on colesevelam, 5/9 (55.6%) had a reduction in Bacteroidia, 9/9 (100%) had an increase in Clostridia, and 7/9 (77.8%) had a reduction in Gammaproteobacteria. Of the 2 patients not given colesevelam, one showed a reduction in Bacteroidia, increase in Clostridia and a reduction in Gammaproteobacteria.ConclusionsThis small pilot study demonstrated that patients who were given colesevelam, were more likely to be in disease remission at their 6-12 months colonoscopy review compared with those not treated. Furthermore, treatment with colesevelam may have a role in altering the microbiome to help maintain remission states in postoperative Crohn's disease. Larger mechanistic studies are now needed to confirm these findings and demonstrate statistical significance as well as investigate whether this benefit may be present even in those patients with 75SeHCAT negative disease.",

Patients self-reported recent perianal symptoms. We retrospectively reviewed the perianal exam documented on colonoscopy reports and in the electronic health record to obtain details of perianal lesions if present. Thirty-three patients were included: median age 15.6 years (interquartile range 12.9-17.5), 27% female, 80% White. There was no association between any perianal symptom and the presence or absence of any perianal lesion (p = 0.85), suggesting the presence or absence of perianal pain and/or anal discharge does not predict whether a patient with CD has perianal lesions.

      "abstract": "Women with Crohn's disease (CD) are often affected during their reproductive years. Live birth rates following assisted reproductive technology (ART) in medically managed CD are comparable to those in the general population. However, ART outcomes decline significantly after CD-related surgery, a pattern not observed in ulcerative colitis (UC). We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with longstanding perianal and vulvovaginal CD who underwent a panproctocolectomy with end ileostomy at age 28. Postoperatively, she developed an enterovaginal fistula and recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Despite being in remission, she achieved only one biochemical pregnancy across five ART cycles. Investigations revealed group B Streptococcus vaginal colonisation and chronic endometritis (CE). This case highlights multiple factors that may impair fertility following surgical management of CD, including pelvic adhesions, CE, microbial dysbiosis, immune dysfunction, and micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin B12. Unlike UC, surgery is not curative in CD and relapse is common. Where possible, major abdominal surgery in CD should be delayed until after childbearing to preserve fertility. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, and preoperative fertility counselling is strongly recommended. Further research and clear clinical guidelines are needed to optimise reproductive outcomes in women undergoing surgery for CD.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic autoinflammatory disorders that share similar clinical and biological features. Both disorders are characterized by chronic and relapsing symptoms. In some cases, FMF can coexist with CD, which makes diagnosis and treatment challenging. Case Presentation: A 9-year-old Egyptian child was diagnosed with CD at the age of 5, based on clinical symptoms and endoscopic histopathologic findings. Initially, the patient responded well to biological therapy (anti-TNFα), showing improvements in symptoms along with declines in inflammatory markers and fecal calprotectin levels. At the age of 7, the child began experiencing frequent episodes of fever accompanied by pleuritic chest pain. Right-sided pleural effusion was identified on repeated chest X-rays. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent acute bacterial pneumonia due to immune suppression and was managed with multiple courses of oral antibiotics. During the last presentation, in one of these episodes, further investigation was pursued due to a lack of response to antibiotics, indicated by persistently elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) and nonresolving mild right-sided pleural effusion. FMF was suspected based on the patient's clinical presentation and chest imaging. A detailed family history revealed a positive FMF diagnosis in a first-degree cousin. Genetic testing was performed, which revealed two heterozygous pathogenic mutations that support the FMF diagnosis. Treatment with colchicine prevented further episodes. The patient continued to receive follow-up care from the GI team for CD and was maintained on adalimumab. Conclusions: FMF should be considered for children with CD who exhibit pulmonary symptoms that do not respond to CD treatment.",

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify predictors of therapeutic success and validated them in a prospective pediatric cohort.MethodsWe searched PubMed and Embase for studies reporting clinical and laboratory predictors of anti-TNF outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD). Identified predictors were evaluated in a prospective cohort of 186 children with CD initiating anti-TNF. Univariable logistic regression assessed individual predictors, and previously published multivariable models were validated using the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsOf the 4840 studies screened, 42 were included; seven (17%) focused on children and only four were rated as low risk of bias. We identified 24 individual predictors and five multi-item models. Of these, prior corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR], 2.84, 95% CI, 1.12-7.15) and immunomodulator combination therapy (OR 6.36, 95% CI, 2.39-17.10) were associated with increased risk of primary non-response. Disease activity at 4 months, reflected by C-reactive protein and disease activity indices, predicted remission at 12 months. Loss of response was associated with elevated inflammatory markers at 4 months and with partial clinical response. The five multivariable models demonstrated varying performance in children (AUC 0.54-0.76).ConclusionOnly a few of the variables suggested to predict response to anti-TNF showed acceptable performance in pediatric CD, mainly those that included post-induction indicators.

Current cytokine-focused treatments remain ineffective, while mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) therapies are hindered by inherent heterogeneity and challenges related to cell viability maintenance, batch-to-batch consistency, and standardization. This study aimed to (Kaplan, 2015 (1)) identify MSCs subtypes targeting CD pathology, Sebastian and Siegmund (2024) (2) create MSCs-mimicking nanoparticles, and (Li et al., 2016 (3)) propose a “deconstructed cell therapy” framework. Using colon datasets and CD blood samples, Th1/Th17-macrophage dysregulation was mapped. Transcriptomic screening of eight MSCs sources identified dental pulp-derived TLR5ʰⁱᵍʰ-MSCs as superior Th1/Th17 inhibitors compared to umbilical cord TLR5ˡᵒʷ-MSCs. In colitis models, TLR5ʰⁱᵍʰ-MSCs intercepted gut flagellin (Fla), blocking macrophage TLR5/NF-κB to restore T-cell balance. Decellularized MSCs membranes were engineered into nanovesicles (TLR5ʰⁱᵍʰ-CMNP), which showed 3.7-fold higher Fla. affinity than antibodies and suppressed Th1/Th17 activity in vitro. In murine colitis, TLR5ʰⁱᵍʰ-CMNP achieved comparable efficacy to MSCs (e.g., 68.9 % reduction in MPO scores), while avoiding challenges associated with live-cell administration — such as embolism occurrence (0 % vs. 24 % in MSCs), need for viability maintenance, and potential variability in TLR5 expression. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed TLR5 as pivotal for MSCs specificity, enabling tailored nanoparticle design. This study highlights TLR5ʰⁱᵍʰ-CMNP as a safer, cell-free MSCs alternative and introduces a paradigm prioritizing precise immune checkpoint targeting (e.g., Fla./TLR5) over broad cytokine suppression, resolving IBD therapeutic ambiguity through scalable biomimetic nanomaterials.",

However, the diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease exhibit high rates of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses, along with significant variability, among primary care facilities and novice endoscopists. Therefore, we established an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) system using double-balloon enteroscopy to facilitate Crohn's disease ulcer identification and grading.ObjectiveTo develop an interpretable AI system for the identification and grading of Crohn's disease ulcer images, offering bounding box localization for visual interpretability and factor-specific grading explanations for each ulcer to improve assessment performance.MethodsWe constructed a region and grading model of individual ulcers based on the YOLO-v5 algorithm. By analyzing the predicted results of all ulcers in each image, the clinical interpretation for the screening and assessment of Crohn's disease ulcer images was further achieved. To evaluate the system, we prepared the training and validation datasets (17,036 double-balloon enteroscopy images, 558 patients) and further collected a test cohort (2018 images, 70 patients) and an external validation set. A further reader study was conducted on the internal test set in which nine endoscopists participated to evaluate the auxiliary effectiveness of the explainable system.ResultsThe Crohn's disease ulcer image detection sensitivity and area under the curve (AUC) were 91.8% and 0.949. The accuracies in assessing the severity of Crohn's disease ulcer images on three factors (size/ulcerated surface/depth) were 94.1%/92.5%/93.0%, respectively. With the system's support of visualized and analyzable predictions, junior endoscopists improved their Crohn's disease ulcer image recognition sensitivity by 12.7% and their accuracy and consistency of severity assessment by 26% and 27.4%.ConclusionThe AI system outperformed general endoscopists in approaching expert-level proficiency in Crohn's disease ulcer identification and assessment.

The study aimed to explore the correlation between computed tomography (CT) value distribution changes of mesenteric-surrounding fat in CD and disease activity.MethodsIn this study, we retrospectively analyzed CT enterography (CTE) images from 47 pathologically confirmed CD patients and 25 randomly selected controls with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Quantitative measurements were obtained for mesenteric adipose tissue density (mean of CT values) along key anatomical landmarks including the mesenteric root, superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, perilesional regions, intestinal stricture, and adjacent branching vascular spaces. Other evaluated parameters included bowel wall thickness, CT attenuation, enhancement patterns, and CF grading. Qualitative evaluations were made by comparing with endoscopic, serological, and histopathological results and simplified CD activity index (CDAI) scores. A patient with concurrent anal fistula underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination to compare its detection efficiency of fistula with that of CT examination.ResultsSignificant inter-group differences were found in non-contrast mesenteric fat attenuation, mean ΔCT (difference in Hounsfield units between contrast-enhanced CT and non-contrast CT scans) enhancement, bowel wall thickening, mucosal enhancement, CF grading, intestinal stricture, and serological parameters (P20 Hounsfield units (HU), P0.6, PConclusionsChanges in mesenteric adipose tissue CT values and CF classification can distinguish CD from other IBD, suggesting their utility as another noninvasive diagnostic method for predicting the inflammatory activity of CD and evaluating the scope of surgery.",

We report the case of a patient with refractory Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome-associated chronic intestinal failure, and long-term home parenteral nutrition who achieved a successful full-term pregnancy while receiving upadacitinib. The 34-year-old woman had a history of severe, treatment-resistant ileocolonic Crohn's disease and multiple intestinal resections, leaving 145 cm of small bowel and resulting in high-output stoma and chronic intestinal failure. After inadequate response to multiple biologics, upadacitinib was initiated with clinical and endoscopic improvement. The patient became pregnant unintentionally while receiving upadacitinib 45 mg daily. Through intensive multidisciplinary management, she achieved clinical remission, stable parenteral support needs, and adequate weight gain and delivered a healthy infant at term. This case illustrates that with close multidisciplinary follow-up, successful pregnancy is possible in patients with chronic intestinal failure and active Crohn's disease receiving parenteral support, even with concurrent exposure to upadacitinib. Further data are needed to assess the safety of JAK inhibitors in pregnancy and to guide care in this complex patient population.",

Plasma trough concentrations were measured by ELISA. Clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ResultsMedian vedolizumab trough concentrations were higher in patients achieving clinical remission compared with those without remission in both intravenous (16.4 vs 10.95 µg/mL, p=0.067) and subcutaneous (37.45 vs 23.05 µg/mL, p=0.134) groups, although differences were not statistically significant. ROC analyses revealed modest predictive capacity for the intravenous group (area under the curve (AUC)=0.676, optimal threshold=11.3 µg/mL, sensitivity=85.7%, specificity=58.3%) and strong predictive ability for the subcutaneous group (AUC=0.813, optimal threshold=25.35 µg/mL, sensitivity=83.3%, specificity=75%). Biochemical remission was not significantly associated with trough concentrations. In multivariable regression analysis, subcutaneous administration, higher albumin and lower FCP were significantly associated with increased vedolizumab concentrations, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) showed a positive association.ConclusionVedolizumab trough concentrations were numerically higher in patients achieving clinical remission, with stronger predictive ability for remission in the subcutaneous group. While isolated trough levels alone may not predict remission, interpretation alongside biomarkers and clinical context can inform therapeutic decisions. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate optimal therapeutic thresholds.",

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for surgical intervention.Main outcome measuresFactors that led to early surgical intervention in patients with intra-abdominal fistulizing Crohn's disease.Sample size73 patients.ResultsSeventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria: 27 (37.0%) in the nonsurgical group and 46 (63.0%) in the surgical group. Early surgical intervention was done if patients had bloating or constipation (P=.018), extensive disease segments (PP=.03), abscesses (OR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.03-26.12, P=.046), and strictures (OR: 6.08, 95% CI: 1.26-29.25, P=.024).

      "abstract": "Mucosal healing in Crohn's disease (CD) has been established as a crucial target of treatment, leading to long term remission and decrease in complication rates. Endoscopy still serves as the gold standard for assessment, particularly in the small bowel where balloon or capsule enteroscopy is frequently needed. However, these modalities are often unavailable, expensive, and invasive, posing risks to patients. Consequently, the identification of accessible and reliable biomarkers, especially in small intestinal CD, remains a challenge. The study by Ohno et al, published in this issue, further illuminates this field. It confirms the potential role of fecal biomarker leucine-rich α2 glycoprotein (LRG) and validates findings from previous smaller trials. Comparing to other markers LRG showed a much higher predictive value for mucosal healing of the small bowel, making it a useful option for small intestinal CD follow up. In this editorial, we explore the optimal marker of inflammation or mucosal healing in CD, particularly in the small bowel.

The aim of this study was to determine if performing pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on newly diagnosed pediatric patients with CD would identify asymptomatic perianal CD and lead to earlier biologic use and less perianal surgery.MethodsPatients were prospectively enrolled into the Edmonton Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic registry (baseline pelvic MRI since 2018). A retrospective review (2018-2023) was performed. A blinded radiologist re-read the positive MRIs using St. James and Parks criteria.ResultsOne hundred thirty-nine patients were included (median age 13 [interquartile range 11-16, range 6-18]). Overall, 19% (n = 27/139) had subclinical perianal disease (MR+/asymptomatic [ASx]). For patients who were both asymptomatic and had a normal perianal examination (n = 86/139, 62%), their subclinical perianal disease rate was similar at 20% (n = 17/86).

Alterations of brain function may contribute to EIS, but their association with disease activity is unclear. This study analyzed intrinsic neural activity (INA) of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) in different disease states and examined the relationship between INA and EIS.MethodsPatients with CD (n = 92) and healthy controls (n = 41) underwent functional magnetic resonance brain imaging and completed symptom-specific psychometry. Temporal (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, ALFF) and spatial (regional homogeneity, ReHo) markers of INA were compared between CD and controls and between active (patients with active Crohn's disease [aCD]) versus remitted (rCD) disease. Regression analyses explored disease-state-dependent associations between INA and EIS.ResultsPatients exhibited aberrant INA in frontotemporal, occipital, and thalamic regions. Patients with aCD exhibited lower ALFF in left subcallosal cortex and inferior temporal gyri compared to rCD. Regional homogeneity in aCD was lower in left medial orbital gyrus and higher in right superior frontal, left inferior temporal, and left precentral gyrus. Compared to rCD, aCD showed higher ALFF predominantly in superior, ventro-, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Distinct associations between INA and EIS were detected in patients, particularly in the remitted state.ConclusionsIntrinsic brain function in patients with CD varies by disease state, with prominent frontal cortex changes in active disease. These brain activity changes are at least partly related to the magnitude of neuropsychiatric symptoms and highlight a role of disturbed brain-gut interactions in the development of EIS especially in rCD.",

At present, there are still no specific markers that make the diagnosis of CD extremely difficult and poor prognosis. Iron deficiency is common in CD, yet the role of ferroptosis-related genes in CD has not been elucidated.MethodsThe serum iron and ferritin levels were detected in 107 newly diagnosed CD patients and 107 healthy volunteers in our hospital. Bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze the chip sequencing data of CD in GEO database. Immunohistochemical analysis of paired inflammatory and noninflammatory intestinal tissues from CD patients was performed to confirm the differential protein expression pattern of the target genes.ResultsPatients with CD exhibited significantly reduced serum iron and ferritin levels compared to healthy controls. Transcriptomic analysis identified 40 upregulated and 31 downregulated ferroptosis-associated genes in CD patients versus controls. LASSO regression and SVM-RFE algorithms prioritized 13 hub genes (e.g., CDKN2A, LCN2, STAT3, MT1G), with a ROC curve demonstrating 100% specificity for combined biomarker analysis. Despite robust bioinformatic predictions, serum RNA levels of CDKN2A, LIG3, and MTF1 showed no intergroup differences. Immuno-reactivity score validated protein expression consistency for LCN2, PANX1, LPIN1, PML, STAT3, PARP9, RELA, NEDD4, and MT1G but not PPARD or LCN2. Expression patterns of these genes correlated with M0 macrophage infiltration, resting mast cells, and neutrophil recruitment, suggesting immune-microenvironment interactions in CD progression.ConclusionCombined detection of ferroptosis-related genes is of great value in the diagnosis of CD.",

This study aimed to investigate the utility of a new urinary biomarker, prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite (PGE-MUM), in assessing CD activity.MethodsThe study involved 87 patients with CD who underwent endoscopic examination and measurements of 4 biomarkers: Prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite, fecal calprotectin (FC), leucine-rich α2 glycoprotein (LRG), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Endoscopic activity was assessed by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD). Correlations between the CD activity index (CDAI) and SES-CD with the 4 biomarkers were analyzed, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to predict SES-CD ≧ 3.ResultsAll 4 biomarkers showed significant correlations with both CDAI and SES-CD. The cutoff (area under the curve [AUC]) values for predicting SES-CD ≥ 3 were as follows: PGE-MUM, 25.2 µg/g Cr (0.800); FC, 257 mg/kg (0.816); LRG, 11.8 µg/mL (0.748); and CRP, 0.22 mg/dL (0.656).

In the L1 group, ROC analysis revealed that, among the 4 biomarkers, PGE-MUM had the highest AUC for predicting SES-CD ≥ 3, with a cutoff (AUC) of 33.1 µg/g Cr (0.861).ConclusionsPGE-MUM is a biomarker that can reflect endoscopic activity in patients with CD and may be particularly useful in small intestinal lesions.",

However, it has been reported that patients with Crohn's disease, who develop severe inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, are more likely to develop sarcopenia. We retrospectively investigated the effect of the iliopsoas muscle area, which is an indicator of sarcopenia, on postoperative complications in patients with Crohn's disease.MethodsWe included 98 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent surgery in our department between January 2016 and December 2021, and performed retrospectively analyzed. The psoas muscle index (PMI) was calculated as the average of the left and right iliopsoas muscles (L3, cm2) / height2. We divided patients into the low PMI (men 2/m2, women 2/m2) and normal PMI groups and compared their preoperative and intraoperative factors and postoperative outcomes.ResultsThe median age of the 98 patients was 37.0 (17-77) years. Complications were noted in 40 patients (40.8%), including 10 (10.2%) with anastomotic leakage. There were 26 (26.5%) patients with a low PMI. The incidence of all postoperative complications, grade ≥2 complications, anastomotic leakage and surgical site infection (SSI) were significantly higher in the low-PMI group than in the normal-PMI group. According to a multivariate analysis, low PMI (p=0.04) was only independent predictor for grade 2 or above postoperative complications.ConclusionsA low PMI is associated with postoperative complications, especially anastomotic leakage, in patients with Crohn's disease.",

Usually, teams encompass colorectal surgery (CRS), gastroenterology (GE), pathology and radiology. Although it is believed that MDT discussion is associated with improved outcomes, there is a scarcity of evidence regarding the benefit or patient selection criteria among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Due to advancements in both medical and surgical management in the management of IBD, clinical decision making may be challenging. Our aim is to identify which patients are currently being presented in MDT meetings and to assess compliance with the MDT's recommendations.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, observational, multiple campus study including all patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) treated within our system during a twelve-month period.

Our aim is to assess the frequency of missed stricturing and internal penetrating complications in CD patients on computed tomography enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) performed prior to anti-TNF therapy.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed patients from two tertiary centers who underwent CTE\\MRE within six months before starting anti-TNF therapy. Patients with prior intestinal surgery, anti-TNF therapy, or radiology reports indicating strictures or penetrating complications were excluded. Two GI radiologists re-evaluated CTE\\MRE images for active inflammation, small bowel strictures (SAR/AGA/SPR criteria), and internal penetrating complications. Senior radiologists reviewed CTE/MRE exams with missed findings and identified potential causes of error. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the prevalence of missed findings. Where applicable, comparisons were made using chi-square test.Results250 CD patients were included. 239 (96%) exhibited active terminal ileal (TI) inflammation by expert review of CTE\\MRE images. Missed TI strictures were identified in 56 patients (22%). 16 patients (6.4%) had unreported penetrating complications, including ileoappendiceal fistulas (n = 6), sinus tracts (n = 6), complex fistulas (n = 4), inflammatory masses (n = 3), ileocecal fistula (n = 1), and abscess (n = 1). There were no significant differences between institutions in the rates of strictures (18/69 vs. 38/181, P = 0.4) or penetrating complications (5/69 vs. 11/181, P = 0.77). 46% of the strictures appeared obvious upon re-evaluation by senior radiologists, potentially implicating a failure to measure associated small bowel dilation. 38% of missed strictures had multifocal areas of luminal narrowing, and maximal proximal dilation was located 10 cm or more proximal to a stricture in 27%.ConclusionA substantial proportion of strictures and penetrating complications in CD are missed at baseline CTE/MRE prior to anti-TNF therapy initiation, even in specialized centers.",

We performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and 16S rRNA microbiome analysis in a patient who developed Crohn's disease-like lesions after allogeneic transplantation. A 62-year-old woman underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation from her daughter to treat double-hit lymphoma relapsed after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and achieved remission without developing acute graft-versus-host disease. Eight months later, she developed Crohn's disease-like intestinal lesions after cytomegalovirus enteritis. Her condition did not improve with the conventional treatment, so she underwent FMT from her daughter as part of a clinical trial. Diarrhea gradually improved, and follow-up endoscopy 4 months after the FMT showed ulcer healing and scarring. The 16S rRNA analysis revealed a reduction in the relative abundance of the Enterococcus genus after FMT, suggesting that dysbiosis may have contributed to lesion development. The patient is currently on a regular diet, with no symptom recurrence, and the primary disease remains in remission. Although this outcome suggests that FMT is effective, careful patient selection is required to reduce the risk of FMT-associated sepsis.",

Despite various treatments, there are scant data on their comparative efficacy to prevent recurrence. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of medical treatments in preventing postoperative recurrence of CD.MethodsA comprehensive literature review was conducted through January 2025. We included randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies, excluding pediatric studies, single-arm trials, and dose comparison studies. The primary endpoint was assessing ER (Rutgeerts score ≥i2) at 6 months, and secondary outcomes were clinical recurrence (Crohn's Disease Activity Index ≥150, Hanauer score ≥2, or Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥8) at 6, 12, and ≥18 months postoperatively. Frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted, reporting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsA total of 42 studies were included, of which 38 were randomized controlled trials, with a total of 2260 patients. At 6 months, adalimumab (ADA) ranked highest in reducing ER (surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA] = 84.5%), followed by vedolizumab (VDZ) (SUCRA = 74.5%). ADA significantly reduced ER compared with thiopurines (THPs) (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.91), probiotics (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.99), and vitamin D (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.37). VDZ did not significantly differ from THPs, ADA, or metronidazole. At 12 months, infliximab (IFX) (SUCRA= 93%) and ADA (SUCRA = 90%) had the lowest ER, with IFX showing significant reductions compared with THPs, metronidazole, and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Similar findings were observed at 18 months, with IFX and ADA maintaining the lowest ER rates. For clinical recurrence, no significant differences were observed among therapies at 6 months; however, at 12 months, ADA and IFX were superior to most therapies, including THPs and budesonide.ConclusionAnti-tumor necrosis factor agents, namely ADA and IFX, are the most effective treatments in reducing postoperative recurrence of CD, followed by VDZ. THPs and antibiotics ranked lower than biologics. Nonpharmacological interventions such as curcumin, vitamin D, and probiotics did not demonstrate efficacy in reducing postoperative recurrence.",

Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275) and briakinumab (ABT-874) are monoclonal antibodies that target the standard p40 subunit of the cytokines interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 (IL-12/23p40), which are involved in the pathogenesis of CD. Briakinumab has been withdrawn for the treatment of CD, making ustekinumab the only available antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 approved for this purpose.ObjectivesTo assess the benefits and harms of anti-IL-12/23p40 antibodies for induction of remission in CD, as compared to no treatment, placebo, other drug treatment, or varying dosing schedules.Search methodsWe searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and MEDLINE (from inception to 2 February 2024) and Embase (from inception until 12 August 2022). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, references, and conference abstracts to identify additional studies.Selection criteriaWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' duration in which monoclonal antibodies against IL-12/23p40 were compared to placebo, no treatment, or another active comparator in people with active CD. We also included trials examining different doses of antibodies against IL-12/23p40.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome was failure to induce clinical remission by week 8, or 6 to 12 as available. Secondary outcomes included failure to induce clinical improvement (clinical response), induction of endoscopic remission, quality of life, and adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome unless substantial heterogeneity was detected. We analyzed data on an intention-to-treat basis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsEight RCTs involving a total of 3224 participants with CD met the inclusion criteria. All studies were double-blinded. We assessed the risk of bias for most outcomes as either low risk of bias or some concerns. Based on a pooled analysis of three trials, ustekinumab decreased the number of participants failing to achieve clinical remission at eight weeks when compared to placebo. Seventy-four per cent (693/938) of participants in the ustekinumab group and 87% (421/483) of those in the placebo group did not enter clinical remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89; 3 studies; 1421 participants; high-certainty evidence). Treatment with ustekinumab likely did not lead to more serious adverse events when compared to placebo, with 5% (48/966) and 6% (30/505) of participants affected in the ustekinumab and placebo groups, respectively (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies; 1471 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A single small study in children compared two different induction doses of ustekinumab. The evidence for this outcome is very uncertain due to wide CIs. Eighty-one per cent (17/21) of participants receiving the higher induction dose (9 mg/kg or 390 mg) did not enter clinical remission at eight weeks, compared to 78% (18/23) of participants receiving the lower induction dose of 3 mg/kg or 130 mg (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.39; 1 study; 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Separate safety data for the eight-week time point were not available for this comparison. Based on one trial comparing ustekinumab to adalimumab, the evidence is very uncertain about which is the more beneficial drug. Fifty per cent (95/191) of participants receiving ustekinumab did not enter remission compared to 52% (101/195) of participants receiving adalimumab (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17; 1 study; 386 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Separate results on adverse events at eight weeks were not reported for this comparison.Authors' conclusionsUstekinumab reduces the risk of people with CD failing to enter clinical remission at eight weeks. It probably does not lead to more serious adverse events when compared to placebo. There were inadequate data to conclude the more effective induction dose of ustekinumab in children. No studies evaluated adverse events at eight weeks for this comparison. There may be little to no difference between ustekinumab and other biologics, such as adalimumab or guselkumab, in inducing clinical remission at week 8, but the evidence is very uncertain, and separate data on adverse events at eight weeks were not available.",

The patient presented with right lower extremity pain and edema, with imaging indicating extensive subcutaneous and fascial inflammation consistent with NF. Emergent surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy were initiated; however, despite intensive care management and escalation of antimicrobial therapy, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. Cultures identified a polymicrobial infection including vancomycin- and linezolid-resistant enterococci (VLRE). The patient ultimately succumbed to septic shock. This case highlights the potential for atypical and fatal infectious complications in patients with long-standing CD, particularly those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and repeated surgical interventions. Timely diagnosis and aggressive management are crucial for improving outcomes in NF; however, treatment is often complicated by diagnostic delays, rapid clinical deterioration, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, all of which pose significant therapeutic challenges.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory granulomatous disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The global incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease have significantly increased, largely due to genetic susceptibility, environmental changes, and advancements in diagnostic technology. In recent years, the pharmacologic treatment of Crohn's disease has been rapidly changing, and although biologics have improved the prognosis of patients to a certain extent, they still have certain limitations. Oral small molecule drugs like JAK inhibitors have become a research hotspot because of their advantages of targeting and regulating the JAK/STAT pathway, convenient administration, and rapid onset of action. JAK inhibitors exhibit divergent therapeutic profiles. Clinical trials have shown that tofacitinib demonstrates limited efficacy in Crohn's disease management. Filgotinib initially showed clinical remission in phase 2 trials; while its subsequent phase 3 studies failed to demonstrate consistent endoscopic improvement. In contrast, upadacitinib achieved notable clinical remission rates during both induction and maintenance phases of phase 2 trials. However, long-term safety concerns, including thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events, opportunistic infections, and potential malignancy risks, warrant cautious clinical application. This article systematically reviews the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease, and the evidence for the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors to guide clinical practice and research.",

Ileocecal resection may serve as a more effective treatment option for early CD. However, the potential relationship and mechanisms between the ileocecum and remission induction of CD are still elusive. In this study, we conducted 16S rRNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on 68 terminal ileal mucosa and mesentery samples from 34 patients with CD. The results showed an improvement in the microbial health of the ileal mucosa and mesentery in patients with CD after ileocecal resection. In addition, specific spatial alterations in microbiota and metabolites were observed before and after surgery. Furthermore, differentially expressed metabolites in the ileal mucosa and mesentery were subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. The findings of this study support the therapeutic value of ileocecal resection in CD from a multi-omics perspective and may guide the clinical translation of microbiome-based strategies for precise treatment of CD.",

      "abstract": "The management of Crohn's disease during pregnancy presents significant challenges. Active Crohn's disease can be treated with corticosteroids or biologics. While these treatments are generally considered safe during pregnancy, they are not without potential side effects, leading to patient hesitancy in initiating therapy despite guidance from inflammatory bowel disease specialists. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 3 weeks before getting pregnant and who opted not to use medication during her pregnancy. For the initial 26-28 weeks, she received conservative treatment. Following a deterioration in her symptoms and an increase in calprotectin levels, she commenced the Crohn's disease exclusion diet (CDED) combined with partial enteral nutrition (PEN). This led to significant symptomatic improvement and a decrease in faecal calprotectin levels. At 40 weeks of gestation, she gave birth to a healthy baby. This case underscores the potential efficacy of CDED and PEN as dietary management strategies for Crohn's disease even during pregnancy, although further research is warranted to compare these approaches with conventional treatments. In addition, it emphasises the critical role of preconception counselling regarding medication safety and effective disease management during pregnancy.",

This study evaluated retinal microvascular changes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods This cross-sectional study included 82 IBD patients (44 UC, 38 CD) and 40 healthy controls. All participants underwent OCTA imaging (AngioVue, Optovue Inc.). Parameters measured: superficial/deep capillary plexus (SCP/DCP) vessel density, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, and non-flow area. Disease activity was assessed using Mayo score (UC) and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Statistical analysis used ANOVA and chi-square tests (SPSS v23.0). Results Higher vascular density was observed in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients compared to healthy controls and UC patients in multiple OCTA parameters (SCP and DCP densities). Additionally, FAZ and non-flow area values were significantly lower in the CD group. These findings suggest increased retinal vascular density in CD, a phenomenon not previously reported. Conclusions OCTA reveals increased retinal vascular density and reduced FAZ in CD patients, suggesting distinct retinal microvascular changes in CD versus UC. These findings support OCTA as a potential biomarker for IBD-related systemic inflammation.",

Our aim was to assess the efficacy of Artesunate and Curcumin in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease, who had ongoing evidence of disease activity despite taking azathioprine.MethodsPatients with Crohn's disease being treated with azathioprine for at least 3 months but still had mild to moderate Crohn's disease (CDAI 150-450) were included. Patients were randomized into four blocks of 10 patients each in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive artesunate 200 mg PO daily for 2 weeks and/or curcumin 200 mg PO daily for 3 months or placebo. Harvey-Bradshaw Index, CDAI, and fecal calprotectin were measured at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.ResultsForty patients were recruited and randomized into the study. Both Artesunate and Curcumin were well tolerated with no adverse effects. The Harvey-Bradshaw Index statistically differed across the treatment groups at 6 months (p = 0.047), there were no significant group differences in the post hoc pairwise analysis. The differences in CDAI from baseline to 6 months were statistically significant in Artesunate + Curcumin (p = 0.0098) and Curcumin + Placebo (p = 0.0431) groups. Similarly, statistically significant differences were observed between Baseline and 6 months for the Harvey-Bradshaw Index in the Artesunate + Curcumin (p = 0.0070) and Curcumin + Placebo (p = 0.0138) groups.ConclusionA combination of artesunate and curcumin in patients with ongoing inflammatory activity appears to be effective as measured by CDAI and Harvey-Bradshaw Index.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundCrohn's disease (CD) is a refractory inflammatory bowel disease with an unclear etiology. CircularRNA (circRNA) has been highlighted as a novel class of functional noncoding RNAs associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases. However, the functions of circRNA in CD remain unclear.MethodsBiopsies were obtained from noninflammatory sites in the terminal ileum of the CD group (n = 4) and non-CD group (n = 4) and analyzed for circRNA expression using RNA sequencing. The significantly altered circRNAs were validated in the CD group (n = 45) and non-CD group (n = 15) using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Transcriptome analysis was conducted using circRNA-downregulated macrophage-like THP-1 cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cytokine mRNA expression, phagocytosis, and migration were evaluated in circRNA-downregulated THP-1 cells.ResultsCircularRNA sequencing analysis revealed significant differences in 31 circRNAs between the CD group and non-CD group. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis for each circRNA demonstrated significant upregulation of hsa_circ_0015388 in the CD group. Hsa_circ_0015388 was expressed in THP-1 cells, but not in HCEC-1CT and Caco-2/bbe. Transcriptome analysis in THP-1 cells transfected with scramble or hsa_circ_0015388 siRNA (small interfering RNA) showed a significant alteration in innate immune response related pathway. Reactive oxygen species production was significantly increased in the hsa_circ_0015388 downregulated THP-1 cells. Reactive oxygen species induction in the hsa_circ_0015388 knocked down THP-1 was diminished by the inhibition of TNFSF10.ConclusionA comprehensive analysis of circRNA expression revealed that 31 circRNAs were dysregulated in the CD group. Hsa_circ_0015388 is expressed in macrophages and negatively regulates ROS function inhibiting the TNFSF10 pathway. This study first revealed that hsa_circ_0015388 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CD by suppressing ROS production in macrophages.",

This may not be the best approach, as different patients may have different treatment responses. Here we extend a method for simulating clinical trials to identify optimal treatments for each patient, and we illustrate this approach in the context of Crohn's disease. Using the data from 15 randomized trials (N = 5703), we used statistical hypothesis testing to identify seven subgroups with distinct responses to three different drug classes. The largest subgroup consisted of patients with equivocal responses to all drug classes, whereas the second largest showed superiority with anti-TNFs. We also identified a subgroup of women over 50 with superior responses to anti-IL-12/23s. Interestingly, this group appeared under-represented in the trials (2%) compared to patients at the University of California (25%). Overall, these results underscore the importance of studying personalized medicine, demonstrate the value of clinical trial data, and provide a roadmap for applying this method broadly across diseases. These results also highlight the importance of diverse and representative recruitment into clinical trials.",

We aimed to evaluate whether optimizing serum adalimumab levels (s-ADL), guided by proactive TDM, is associated with improved markers of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.Materials and methodsIn this longitudinal cross-sectional study, 72 patients receiving adalimumab maintenance therapy from our outpatient clinic, were included. Patients underwent five study visits at 3-month intervals over one year. Disease activity was assesed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin. s-ADL levels were measured at each visit, and dosing was adjusted to maintain a therapeutic target range of 5.0-12.0 mg/L.ResultsAt baseline, subtherapeutic s-ADL levels were associated with higher CRP levels (p = 0.03), and in these patients' drug levels increased significantly over the study (p = 0.001), whereas CRP levels decreased (p = 0.03). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that higher s-ADL levels (≥5.0 mg/L) were associated with lower CRP levels (p = 0.008) and lower HBI scores (p = 0.03). Additionally, lower CRP- and fecal calprotectin levels at any visit were associated with higher s-ADL levels at the preceding visit (p = 0.04 for both). Lower CRP levels were also associated with higher s-ADL levels using 7.0 mg/L as the therapeutic threshold in longitudinal analyses (p = 0.003).ConclusionProactive TDM-guided optimization of s-ADL levels in Crohn's disease patients on adalimumab maintenance therapy was associated with the modest but significant improvements in markers of disease activity over one year of follow-up.",

However, repeated colonoscopy is invasive and resource-intensive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive biomarkers and imaging measures for detecting endoscopic CD recurrence, as compared with colonoscopy.MethodsA systematic review was conducted to January 31, 2024, to identify studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography, or intestinal ultrasound (IUS) compared with colonoscopy for detecting CD recurrence. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were pooled using a random-effects hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model.ResultsA total of 17 studies (N = 1080) evaluated inflammatory biomarkers and 20 studies (N = 1053) assessed imaging measures. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CRP (threshold, 5.0 mg/L) were 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.58) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.68-0.92), respectively. Fecal calprotectin (threshold, 50 μg/g) was moderately sensitive 0.76 (95% CI, 0.70-0.82) but less specific 0.66 (95% CI, 0.56-0.75). Sensitivity for computed tomography enterography/magnetic resonance enterography and IUS was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.75-0.96); specificity was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43-0.82) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.52-0.90), respectively. Using optimized radiographic parameters for IUS, specificity was improved to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71-0.93).ConclusionThe high sensitivity of fecal calprotectin (<50 μg/g) and cross-sectional imaging can help reduce the need for invasive and costly colonoscopy monitoring for CD recurrence after surgery. Applying optimal definitions of sonographic recurrence by IUS parameters may further improve specificity for making therapeutic decisions without endoscopy.",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown differences in brain function between patients with CD and healthy controls (HC). This study aimed to compare the neural correlates of anxiety inindividuals with CD relative to HC, using resting-state fMRI data.MethodsParticipants filled in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a validated tool for measuring anxiety, and underwent an MRI acquisition, including both structural and functional sequences, to identify brain regions associated with anxiety scores.ResultsSeventeen patients with CD and eighteen HC matched for age, education, and sex participated in the study. No significant group differences emerged in the STAI scores. However, resting-state fMRI analysis revealed distinct patterns of functional connectivity associated with anxiety scores for the two study groups. Among CD group, greater STAI scores correlated with increased functional connectivity, whereas, in HC, they correlated with decreased functional connectivity. Significant clusters were found in brain regions belonging to specific resting-state networks (RSNs): (a) Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC, within the Default Mode Network), (b) left Middle Frontal Gyrus (within the Left Fronto-Parietal Network), and (c) PCC and right Superior Temporal Gyrus (within the Dorsal Attention Network).ConclusionThe differential association between functional connectivity and STAI scores observed for CD and HC participants was located in areas within self-referential (Default Mode Network) and cognitive (Left Fronto-Parietal Network and Dorsal Attention Network) RSNs.

ER analyses were based on data from Phase 3 BERGAMOT trial, which evaluated etrolizumab at 105 or 210 mg during induction phase and 105 mg during maintenance phase. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to characterize etrolizumab PK and identify influential covariates. ER analyses were conducted at end of induction and maintenance for clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and endoscopic remission. ER modeling was performed using logistic regression, and full covariate model was used to examine the impact of baseline covariates on clinical outcomes. Pharmacokinetics of etrolizumab was best characterized using a two-compartment model with first-order absorption, demonstrating a time-dependent decrease in clearance. Typical maximum reduction of clearance was 22.0% (95% CI: 20.5%-23.5%) with onset half-life of 3.45 (95% CI: 2.84-4.04) weeks. Baseline body weight, albumin, and C-reactive protein were the most impactful covariates for etrolizumab exposure. Based on population PK results, trough concentration at Week 4 of induction was selected as exposure metric. Etrolizumab exposure-response slope was significant (P < .05) for clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and endoscopic remission final models in maintenance phase, but none of final ER models of induction phase. For all induction ER endpoints, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naive patients had significantly higher probability of a favorable outcome at end of induction compared to TNF-experienced patients. In summary, exposure-response was more evident at end of maintenance than at end of induction.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundThe differentiation between gastrointestinal tuberculosis (GITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) is challenging. Detection of urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a glycolipid component of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, has shown potential as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for tuberculosis.ObjectiveWe evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of urinary LAM in distinguishing GITB from CD.MethodsThis prospective study included patients diagnosed with GITB, CD or those with indeterminate conditions (January 2021 to April 2022). Comprehensive clinical evaluations, laboratory investigations, computed tomography (CT) enterography, colonoscopy and histopathological analyses were performed. First morning midstream urine samples were collected and analyzed using TB LAM antigen kit. The analytical team was blinded from the clinical data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall diagnostic accuracy of urinary LAM were determined.ResultsOf 98 patients, 36 were diagnosed with GITB and 62 with CD. Urinary LAM was positive in nine out of 36 GITB patients, yielding a sensitivity of 25% (95% C.I. 12.12-42.20%) and a PPV of 100% (95% C.I. 66.37-100.00%). None of the CD patients tested positive for urinary LAM, resulting in a specificity of 100% (95% C.I. 94.22-100.00%) and NPV of 69.66% (95% C.I. 65.54-73.50%). Overall diagnostic accuracy of urinary LAM in differentiating GITB from CD was 72.45% (95% C.I. 62.54-80.99%). Notably, the addition of urinary LAM testing to the existing diagnostic criteria improved the accurate identification of GITB from 44% to 55.6%.ConclusionUrinary LAM testing exhibits high specificity and PPV, making it a significant adjunct in the diagnostic process for GITB.",

This study assessed the long-term efficacy of ustekinumab in PFCD.MethodsA total of 143 CD patients with perianal fistulas who initiated ustekinumab therapy were enrolled. Clinical remission was defined as the absence of pain and drainage from fistula tracts, as assessed by physicians. Deep remission was defined as concurrent clinical remission and radiological healing.ResultsThe study population comprised 143 patients, with a mean age of 28.6 years and a mean number of prior perianal surgeries of 2.5. Overall, 77.6 % of patients had complex fistulas, and 65.7 % experienced prior biologic failure. During a median follow-up of 136.0 (108-156) weeks, 22/143 (18.5 %) patients discontinued ustekinumab therapy. Among patients with active PFCD, clinical remission was achieved in 88/119 (73.9 %) patients. Deep remission was achieved in 40 of 100 evaluable patients (40.0 %), typically 32.1 weeks after clinical remission. Multivariate analysis identified prior exposure to biological agents (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.73, P = 0.004) and ileocolonic lesions (HR = 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.23-0.96, P = 0.040) as negative predictors of deep remission. Recurrence was rare (6.3 %), with a 2-year recurrence-free survival rate of 93.4 %.ConclusionsUstekinumab demonstrates remarkable efficacy in achieving sustained clinical and deep remission in PFCD.

Biologic-naïve adults (≥18 years) with CD were included if they had ≥12 months of continuous enrollment before and after initiating Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biologics (2015-2021). Outcomes included treatment persistence, switching, dose escalation, augmentation, and HCRU over 12-36 months of follow-up. Dose escalation and augmentation were defined based on therapy adjustments or concurrent use of conventional treatments. Descriptive and Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 to evaluate treatment patterns and outcomes.ResultsOf 390,396 patients with a qualifying claim during the index period, 7,353 biologic-naïve patients with CD met the inclusion criteria. The cohort had a mean age of 39.2 (standard deviation [SD]: 13.8) years, 51.4% were female, and 97.2% had commercial insurance. Follow-up averaged 32.5 (SD: 17.2) months, with 59.5% having ≥24 months of follow-up. Adalimumab (50.6%) and infliximab (26.9%) were the most common first-line therapies. Ustekinumab as first-line therapy showed numerically highest persistence (12 months: 79.0%; 24 months: 69.9%) and highest dose escalation rates among biologics. Median time to augmentation was 1.5 months for first-line therapies. Total CD-related costs per year varied across therapy groups, with ustekinumab having numerically highest costs ($135,311 [SD: 69,162]).ConclusionThis analysis reveals variability in biologic treatment patterns. Most biologic-naïve patients start with anti-TNFs, even though other therapies show numerically higher persistence than anti-TNFs, highlighting the need for effective treatment sequencing and monitoring. Rising healthcare costs emphasize strategic decisions for effective biologics and efficient resource allocation in real-world settings.",

We aimed to compare two population-based cohorts of CD patients in Navarra, Spain, diagnosed in 2001-2003 (cohort A) and in 2017 (cohort B), to assess whether early use of advanced therapies has altered disease trajectory.Patients and methodsThis prospective, multicentre cohort study included adult patients with confirmed CD from two periods. Clinical characteristics, treatments, hospitalizations, and surgical outcomes were analysed over five years. Time-to-event analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models.ResultsA total of 128 patients were included (83 in cohort A, 45 in cohort B). At diagnosis, immunomodulators were used in 1.2% of cohort A vs. 21% in cohort B, and biologics in 0% vs. 51%, respectively. Initiation of immunomodulators (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.11-3.39) and biologics (HR: 5.42; 95% CI: 2.57-11.42) occurred earlier in cohort B.

Adjusted multivariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses were used for feature selection. A nomogram was developed and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.ResultsAltogether 490 patients were included, among whom 67 (13.7%) received CD-related bowel resection during a median follow-up of 45.2 months. Stricturing or penetrating behavior, perianal involvement, and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) were independently associated with a higher risk of CD-related bowel resection, while higher white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte levels and hemoglobin levels were protective factors. The nomogram including disease behavior, hemoglobin, CRP, and lymphocyte and WBC counts yielded a C-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.86) in 10-fold cross-validation of the training set.

The Simplified Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (sMARIA) is a validated scoring system used to quantify Crohn's disease (CD) activity based on Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) findings. This study aims to evaluate the performance of two advanced LLMs in extracting key imaging features and computing sMARIA scores from free-text MRE reports.Materials and methodsThis retrospective study included 117 anonymized free-text MRE reports from patients with confirmed CD. ChatGPT (GPT-4o) and DeepSeek (DeepSeek-R1) were prompted using a structured input designed to extract four key radiologic features relevant to sMARIA: bowel wall thickness, mural edema, perienteric fat stranding, and ulceration. LLM outputs were evaluated against radiologist annotations at both the segment and feature levels. Segment-level agreement was assessed using accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation. Feature-level performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Errors including confabulations were recorded descriptively.ResultsChatGPT achieved a segment-level accuracy of 98.6%, MAE of 0.17, and Pearson correlation of 0.99. DeepSeek achieved 97.3% accuracy, MAE of 0.51, and correlation of 0.96. At the feature level, ChatGPT yielded an F1-score of 98.8% (precision 97.8%, sensitivity 99.9%), while DeepSeek achieved 97.9% (precision 96.0%, sensitivity 99.8%).ConclusionsLLMs demonstrate near-human accuracy in extracting structured information and computing sMARIA scores from free-text MRE reports. This enables automated assessment of CD activity without altering current reporting workflows, supporting longitudinal monitoring and large-scale research.

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease is a form of inflammation that affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is characterized by persistent inflammation in the gut, which can lead to the formation of abnormal connections called fistulas. These fistulas can occur between the GI tract and the abdominal cavity, adjacent organs, or the skin. The most prevalent type of fistula in Crohn's disease patients is the perianal fistula, which forms between the rectum and the skin near the anus. Although the exact cause of fistula formation is not fully understood, research suggests that factors such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition, matrix metalloproteinase, immune system dysregulation, and microbiota may contribute to their development. There is currently no definitive treatment for fistula closure, but options include surgery, endoscopic procedures, antibiotics, biologic agents, and immunosuppressive drugs. These treatments can be used alone or in combination. However, recurrence is a significant challenge that needs to be addressed in the case of fistula treatment. This review provides an overview of the common types of fistulas, their characteristics, the main factors and mechanisms of fistula formation, and available therapeutic options.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence from diverse populations highlights the therapeutic benefits of the Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) in managing Crohn's Disease. To improve the efficacy of the CDED, there is a need to focus on cultural adaptation and individualization to support dietary adherence to this advanced nutritional therapy. This paper provides a theoretical framework for modifying the CDED to align with a Nordic diet (Nordic-CDED), while retaining the core principles and nutritional characteristics of the original protocol. Through a comprehensive literature review and expert consensus, we propose a Nordic-CDED that incorporates European regulations on food additives, the 2023 Nordic Nutritional Recommendations, and Nordic food culture. We present a theoretical foundation for an inclusion of whole foods and discuss the selection of enteral formulas. The adaptation also emphasizes the importance of dietitian-led guidance to tailor the Nordic-CDED to the patient's age, lifestyle, and personal preferences. Further research is required to assess the clinical effectiveness and adherence to the Nordic-CDED.",

Subtherapeutic tacrolimus levels can lead to rejection and development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA), resulting in the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. We present a boy who underwent an ABO blood groupincompatible heart transplant at 10 months of age, and developed diarrhea and subtherapeutic tacrolimus levels with subsequent development of de novo DSA, and then acute cellular and antibody-mediated rejection. He was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which required vedolizumab for control. Despite aggressive reduction of his DSA, he developed rapidly progressive cardiac allograft vasculopathy and required retransplant, with a high prevalence of plasma cells in the explanted heart. Donor-directed blood group antibodies remained negative. This case demonstrates the importance of early consideration of inflammatory bowel disease for patients with diarrhea and subtherapeutic tacrolimus levels, as prompt diagnosis and treatment may prevent secondary graft injury.",

This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers and elucidate macrophage-related pathogenesis in CD.MethodsUsing gene expression data (GSE17928522) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we compared 1135 CD patients with 180 healthy controls to identify altered gene expression profiles. Immune infiltration analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in immune cell subpopulations. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was employed to construct gene co-expression networks and identify macrophage-associated modules. Mendelian randomization was used to validate the causal role of macrophages. For ex vivo validation, immunohistochemical staining of GBP4 protein expression was performed in colonic tissue samples from 6 CD patients (with ileal or colonic lesions). Non-lesional tissues from the same patients served as intra-individual controls to minimize inter-patient variability.ResultsOur analysis revealed significant changes in immune cell subpopulations, particularly macrophages, within the CD microenvironment. A macrophage-associated module was identified, with GBP4 emerging as a critical gene. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed differential expression of GBP4 in CD tissue samples compared to controls.DiscussionThis multi-modal study establishes GBP4 as a novel macrophage-associated biomarker for CD, supported by causal Mendelian randomization and immunohistochemical validation. The integration of WGCNA and genetic evidence strengthens the role of macrophage dysregulation in CD pathogenesis. Limitations include population bias in genomic data and small validation cohorts, but the consistency across methodologies underscores GBP4's potential as a therapeutic target.ConclusionOur findings highlight GBP4 as a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CD, providing insights into the immune-mediated mechanisms underlying the disease. These results contribute to a better understanding of CD pathogenesis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies.",

Upon her admission, a physical assessment indicated tachycardia and abdominal sensitivity, while imaging examinations corroborated gastrointestinal perforation along with signs of acute diffuse peritonitis. The patient had a prior history of Crohn's disease and had been off medication for over a year. The initial surgical intervention entailed bowel resection and adhesiolysis; however, postoperative complications arose, prompting a second operation due to suspected anastomotic leakage and a severe infection. In spite of these challenges, the patient received intensive care, nutritional support, and treatment for short bowel syndrome. Over span of a month, her health significantly improved, and she was ultimately discharged with ongoing management for her Crohn's disease.

CD-associated fistula carcinomas (Fi-Cas), though rare, pose diagnostic and prognostic challenges. This study aims to identify disease-defining immune cell subsets in CD-associated Fi-Cas.MethodsThe study included tissue samples from 10 CD patients with Fi-Cas, 7 with CD-associated fistulas, and 6 with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). The main tumor (MT), infiltration front, and non-involved areas were analyzed in tumor samples. A 36-marker panel was employed to define the immune landscape using imaging mass cytometry. Samples were processed, stained, and analyzed for immune cell compositions, cell-cell interactions, and spatial microenvironments.ResultsThe immune infiltrate in Fi-Cas shared similarities with both CD fistulas and CRC. Fi-Ca samples exhibited high levels of neutrophils, B cells, and CD163high macrophages. CRC MT samples showed an increased presence of intraepithelial CD8+ lymphocytes and CD163low macrophages. Cleaved Caspase-3 levels were highest in CRC MT samples, correlating positively with CD163low macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, Fi-Ca MT samples showed a negative correlation between cleaved Caspase-3 and cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of cellular microenvironments and dimensionality reduction clustering based on immune cell frequencies indicated Fi-Cas to exhibit a mixture of immune cell characteristics from both CD fistulas and CRC.ConclusionsThe immune landscape of CD-associated Fi-Cas exhibits features of both CD fistulas and CRC, suggesting a complex pathogenesis influenced by chronic inflammation. Our data suggest that Fi-Cas represent a unique cancer subtype, that requires further analysis to develop targeted therapeutic strategies.",

The correlation between the rs2241880 variant and CD was assessed with a combined effect size of the calculated 95% confidence interval (CI) and odds ratio (OR). Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 value among genetic models. Publication bias was tested using the Egger test and funnel plot.ResultsThe rs2241880 G allele is positively correlated with the risk of CD worldwide, with an OR of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.29-1.37) for the comparison of G vs. A. This variant is identified as a risk factor for CD progression across all racial subgroups, particularly highlighting an association between Mongolians and CD risk (G vs. A: OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15-1.34). Furthermore, there are statistically significant differences observed across age subgroups, with adults showing an OR of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.29-1.38) and children an OR of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.10-1.47). Gender-wise, the risk remains significant with a male vs. female comparison yielding an OR of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.29-1.37). Additionally, when comparing the overall co-dominant models, GA carriers exhibited a lower risk compared to GG carriers. Specifically, GA vs. AA showed an OR of 1.30 (95% CI: 1.23-1.38), while GG vs. AA revealed a higher risk with an OR of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.65-1.88).ConclusionThe ATG16L1 rs2241880 G allele is associated with an increased risk of CD globally, acting as a risk factor across various demographics, including age (both adults and children), gender, and particularly within Mongolian populations. A gene dosage-dependent effect may enhance the strength of this association, as GG carriers of the ATG16L1 rs2241880 G/A allele polymorphism exhibit a higher risk for CD compared to GA carriers.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the intestine, accompanied by extraintestinal symptoms and immune problems. The progression of the disease may cause permanent damage to the structure and function of the intestine. Due to unclear early symptoms and lack of precise detection methods, early diagnosis of CD is difficult. Many patients were diagnosis at late stage, which may lead to delayed treatment and increased risk of complications. Identifying hub genes related to CD and using them to predict CD is of great significance. Methods: DEG and WGCNA were employed to identify key genes associated with CD and to detect modules significantly linked to the disease. GO and KEGG analyses were conducted to explore the functions of these identified genes. Additionally, MR method was utilized to assess the causal relationships between the most significant gene and CD. Results: WCGNA identified 3240 differentially expressed genes, with the magenta module being the most significant among the nine clustered modules. The enrichment of GO and KEGG pathways indicates that the hub genes in the magenta module are related to the positive regulation of heme binding, tetrapyrrole binding, carboxylic acid binding, organic acid binding, IL-17 signaling pathway, and amoebiasis pathway. The Top 5 hub genes are CXCL1, LCN2, NOS2, S100A8, and DUOX2. Mendelian randomization analysis found a significant correlation between CXCL1 and CD. Conclusions: The study screened five potential biomarker genes in CD patients using a bioinformatics approach and Mendelian randomization study. Our results provided insights into CXCL1, LCN2, NOS2, S100A8, and DUOX2 in CD and suggested that CXCL1 may potentially be the optimal biomarker that could be a relatively easy path to clinical translation.",

Acute exacerbations pose a diagnostic challenge due to the difficulty in distinguishing active Crohn's disease from other causes, particularly infections. While Clostridium difficile infection is well-documented and typically screened for in symptomatic Crohn's patients, other enteric infections are often under-recognized and lack sufficient evidence. We report the case of a 17-year-old male with known colonic Crohn's disease who presented with a five-day history of fever and diarrhea. Initial treatment with ciprofloxacin was ineffective, suggesting a quinolone-resistant pathogen. Traditional diagnostic approaches, including stool cultures, failed to identify the pathogen. However, subsequent multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing of stool samples identified Campylobacter species, and signi-ficant clinical improvement was observed following azithromycin therapy. This case underscores the importance of considering non-Clostridium difficile infections in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease flares and highlights the clinical utility of multiplex polymerase chain reaction in rapidly identifying resistant pathogens. Implementing such molecular diagnostics is crucial for improving patient outcomes.",

Under certain conditions, such as in Crohn's disease, a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease, some symbionts bloom to cause disease in genetically susceptible hosts. Although the identity and function of disease-causing microorganisms or pathobionts in Crohn's disease remain largely unknown, mounting evidence from animal models suggests that pathobionts triggering Crohn's disease-like colitis inhabit certain niches and penetrate the intestinal tissue to trigger inflammation. In this Review, we discuss the distinct niches occupied by intestinal symbionts and the evidence that pathobionts triggering Crohn's disease live in the mucus layer or near the intestinal epithelium. We also discuss how Crohn's disease-associated mutations in the host disrupt intestinal homeostasis by promoting the penetration and accumulation of pathobionts in the intestinal tissue. Finally, we discuss the potential role of microbiome-based interventions in precision therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Crohn's disease.",

The primary outcome was frequency of steroid-free clinical remission at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included time to steroid-free clinical remission, frequency of clinical and biochemical remission, drug escalation and discontinuation, serum level data, and adverse events. Standard descriptive and comparative statistics were performed. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with steroid-free remission at 1 year.

      "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD), are at risk of complications, including kidney disease. It is important to identify IBD patients at higher risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to improve prevention and treatment. Here, we investigated the clinical and metabolomic characteristics of CD patients who develop CKD.MethodsWe identified adult CD patients with (CD + CKD, n = 87) and selected CD patients without CKD (CD controls) matched by age, race, and gender. We collected data on demographic characteristics (age, smoking status, ethnicity, gender), IBD characteristics (diagnosis, Montreal classification, medication use, IBD-related surgeries, perianal disease), and kidney-related factors (primary sclerosing cholangitis, end-stage renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, organ transplantation, and nephrolithiasis). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted and odds ratios were calculated to identify risk factors for CKD. Serum samples were collected for untargeted metabolomic analysis.ResultsChronic kidney disease was far more common in CD patients than UC patients. Crohn's disease patients with kidney stones had a 10-fold higher risk of developing CKD than those without kidney stones. Crohn's disease patients with more than 2 IBD-related surgeries had a 7.3-fold higher risk of developing CKD than those who had not undergone surgery. There was no relationship between the number of biologics used or mesalamine use and the risk of CKD. The serum of CD + CKD patients had elevated levels of pro-inflammatory metabolites and those linked to kidney injury.ConclusionsWe recommend regular kidney function monitoring and ensuring proper hydration to prevent or manage potential kidney-related complications in CD patients. Patients with resections and kidney stones are particularly vulnerable.",

In this pilot trial, we aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and fecal microbial compositional and functional alterations associated with 'Mycodigest,' a commercial prebiotic supplement composed of three mushroom extracts. Patients with mild to moderate CD were recruited to a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot induction trial. Clinical efficacy using the Harvey-Bradshaw index and biochemical response using C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin were assessed at week 8 post-intervention. Fecal samples were assessed by DNA shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A multivariable linear mixed effects model was used to assess alteration in fecal microbiome composition and function pre- and post-'Mycodigest' intervention. Clinical response was higher in the 'Mycodigest' intervention (N = 10) compared to the placebo (N = 6) group (80 vs. 16.7%, respectively, p = 0.035). There were no differences in terms of biochemical response within each group pre- and post-intervention. Post-'Mycodigest' intervention, 25 species were found to be differentially abundant compared to baseline, including increase in short chain fatty acid producing bacteria, such as Parabacteroides distasonis (Beta coefficient 0.92, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 0.36-1.47) and Faecalimonas umbilicata (Beta coefficient 0.57, 95% CI 0.23-0.90). Two microbial pathways related to the metabolism of isoprenoid compounds were increased post-'Mycodigest' intervention. Mushroom based prebiotic supplementation in subjects with CD resulted in clinical improvement which may be related to post-intervention favorable compositional and functional microbial alterations.",

This study evaluates the impact of a transdisciplinary collaboration in intestinal ultrasound (IUS), focusing on its cost savings and environmental sustainability.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of IUS performed at a tertiary referral hospital in Singapore between October 2023 and June 2024. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) underwent IUS as part of their clinical evaluation. The multidisciplinary team included four radiographers and two radiologists, all trained in IUS, and five gastroenterologists. Data collected included patient demographics, diagnosis, imaging history, and institutional costs for procedures. Estimates for energy consumption and carbon emissions were derived from published literature.Results26 patients (16 males, 10 females) with CD underwent 34 IUS examinations. IUS findings led to MRE avoidance in 27 cases (n = 27/34; 79.4 %) and colonoscopy in 20 cases (n = 20/34; 58.8 %), eliminating the need for 540 ml of gadolinium-based contrast and 36,450 ml of barium sulphate suspension. Compared to MRE pathway, there was an estimated cost saving of US$29,619, reduction in energy consumption by approximately 304.83 kWh, equivalent to 458.19 kg of CO2e. Compared to endoscopy pathway, estimated cost saving was US$25,940 with 3181.0 kWh reduction in energy consumption, equivalent to 557.40 kg of CO2e.ConclusionIUS is a cost efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to MRE. Its addition to routine IBD care is a promising step towards high-quality, value-based decision-making while reducing the carbon footprint of radiological investigations.Implications for practiceThe success of this initiative highlights the importance of transdisciplinary collaboration. Involving trained radiographers in IUS delivery can streamline imaging workflows, enhance access, reduce healthcare costs, and align clinical practice with sustainability goals.",

Patients with newly diagnosed CD were followed annually. Risk factors of bowel surgery for complications such as obstruction, fistula, perforation, and bleeding were evaluated.ResultsThe cohort consisted of 438 patients with newly diagnosed CD, with a male predominance (73.5%) and a median age of 28 years. Of these, 68 patients underwent bowel surgery, with the 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative surgery rates being 11.8%, 14.3%, and 15.4%. Multivariate analysis identified patient enrollment in the third year (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.99), smoking (aHR 3.57, 95% CI 1.70-7.47), stricturing (aHR 31.38, 95% CI 10.93-90.07) or penetrating behavior (aHR 39.83, 95% CI 13.16-120.58), and hypoalbuminemia (aHR 1.95, 95% CI 1.12-3.38) as independent predictors.

Here, we present the overall results of the entire population of U-ENDURE (N = 673).MethodsClinical responders to 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) induction were randomized (1:1:1) to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD (n = 221), upadacitinib 30 mg QD (n = 229), or placebo (n = 223) as maintenance therapy for 52 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 52. Safety was assessed through week 52.ResultsAt week 52, more upadacitinib-treated vs placebo patients achieved CDAI clinical remission (upadacitinib 15 mg, 36.2% and upadacitinib 30 mg, 51.5% vs placebo, 15.2%). The rates of endoscopic response were 27.3% for upadacitinib 15 mg and 40.7% for upadacitinib 30 mg vs 7.2% for placebo. Exposure-adjusted event rates for treatment-emergent adverse events were numerically lower with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg vs placebo (351.3 and 324.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively, vs 462.8 per 100 patient-years) except for COVID-19 and adverse events leading to early discontinuation of study treatment.

The aim was to investigate if offspring exposure to maternal Inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), or specifically the IBD disorder Crohn's disease, during gestation is associated with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders in childhood.Material and methodsWe conducted a population-based registry study in Finland. All live births from 1996 until 2014 in Finland were included and followed up until December 2018. Exposure was maternal IBD or Crohn's disease. Outcome was a broad range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to assess association. Sensitivity analyses included assessing, for example, exposure to severe episode of IBD or Crohn's disease, the outcome psychotropic medication for the children, and influence from perinatal risk factors.ResultsOf the participants (N = 1 105 997), 0.55% (N = 6067) were exposed to maternal IBD 0.18% (N = 1959) to maternal Crohn's disease. Among the children exposed to IBD or the subgroup Crohn's disease, 6.3% or 7.3%, respectively, had received an outcome diagnosis during the follow-up. There were higher risks for Sleeping disorders HR = 1.77 (95% CI, 1.13-2.78), Other feeding disorders HR = 1.83 (95% CI, 1.19, 2.19), and Incontinence HR = 1.42 (95% CI, 1.02-1.97) in children exposed to maternal Crohn's disease compared to unexposed children. This was supported by even higher point risk estimates for Incontinence HR = 2.43 (95% CI, 1.34-4.38) and Other feeding disorders HR = 2.83 (95% CI, 1.35-5.91) in offspring where the mother was hospitalized for Crohn's disease during pregnancy.

      "abstract": "Long-standing Crohn's disease (CD) is well known to be associated with gastrointestinal malignancies. Patients with CD have a higher risk of developing small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) compared to healthy individuals. However, CD-associated SBA is not as common as colorectal cancer. While patients with CD often present with complicated stricture lesions in the small intestine, it is difficult to confirm all lesions by endoscopy. There is still no consensus on the surgical treatment of small bowel strictures with suspected CD-associated SBA. We report a case of small bowel high-grade dysplasia and two cases with advanced SBA. Case 1 involved a 53-year-old man whose high-grade dysplastic lesion of the small intestine was discovered incidentally postoperatively and successfully resected curatively. Case 2 was that of a 60-year-old man and Case 3 involved a 69-year-old man. Both patients had multiple small bowel stenotic lesions and were diagnosed with advanced small bowel cancer during follow-up. In conclusion, for patients with long-standing Crohn's disease who are refractory to treatment or have stenotic lesions, surgical resection should be considered as a treatment option with CD-associated SBA in consideration.",

      "abstract": "Background and aimsSarcopenia has a negative impact on clinical outcome in adult patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), but data on children are scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia in children with CD using magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and describe its relationship with baseline values and clinical outcome.MethodsWe included children with a new diagnosis of CD from 2 tertiary referral pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) centres, who underwent MRE at diagnosis between 2013 and 2023. Muscle mass was assessed by measuring the total area of the total psoas muscle (tPMA) at the level of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae (L4/L5). Data were compared with pediatric reference values of tPMA, and sarcopenia was defined as a tPMA below the 3rd percentile. Demographic and anthropometric data, laboratory results, clinical disease activity and endoscopic index were collected at diagnosis and during follow-up. Clinical outcomes included relapse frequency, treatment changes, surgery, and IBD-related complications.ResultsA total of 74 children (25 females, mean age 13.2 years) with CD were enrolled in the study. Sarcopenia was present in 34/74 patients (46 %) at diagnosis. Patients with sarcopenia had a lower Body Mass Index z-score and hemoglobin levels. Clinical disease activity (assessed using the Pediatric CD Activity Index) and endoscopic activity (assessed using the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD) were significantly higher in sarcopenic compared to non-sarcopenic children (median and quartiles scores: 25 [20, 40] vs. 21 [13, 35] and 10 [5, 13] vs. 6 [3, 13], respectively). During the follow-up period (median: 35 months; range: 1-99 months), no significant differences were observed between the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups in terms of the composite outcome (defined as the occurrence of at least one unfavorable event). However, the rate of flares (number per person-year) was also higher in sarcopenic children compared to non-sarcopenic ones (27 % vs. 15 %; p = 0.0679).ConclusionsSarcopenia is highly prevalent among children with CD at diagnosis. MRE-based muscle mass measurement correlates with traditional anthropometric measurements and can be valuable for comprehensive nutritional screening in pediatric CD patients. Patients with sarcopenia presented with more severe clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic findings at diagnosis; although sarcopenic children experienced more clinical relapses we were not able to show a significant association between sarcopenia and outcomes. Larger series need to be studied.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundCrohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterised by intestinal dysbiosis. While inflammation-induced leakage of host proteins is a known phenomenon in CD, how these proteins affect the gut microbiota and contribute to dysbiosis remains unclear. One hypothesis is that commensal bacteria hijack these proteins, exacerbating inflammation in CD.DesignTo investigate host-microbiota interactions in CD, we measured fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) levels in patients with CD and in mouse models of dextran sulfate sodium induced enteritis and interleukin 10 knockout spontaneous enteritis. Proteomic approaches, including bacterial pull-down and mass spectrometry, were employed to identify commensal targets of FABP2. Functional studies were conducted using wild type and EF3041-deficient Enterococcus faecalis strains, along with α-FABP2 antibody treatment, to assess their effects on intestinal inflammation and microbiota composition.ResultsFABP2 levels were elevated in plasma and faeces of patients with CD, as well as in the mouse models. This was accompanied by dysbiosis of gut commensal bacteria. E. faecalis hijacked luminal FABP2 to promote its proliferation via pheromone-binding protein EF3041, which activated quorum-sensing pathways. Deletion of EF3041 abolished this response, while complementation with EF3041 restored it. Injection of α-FABP2 antibody or transplantation of ΔEF3041 mutant strain significantly reduced epithelial damage, mitigated dysbiosis and alleviated inflammation and symptoms of enteritis in mice.ConclusionThis study reveals a novel mechanism by which commensal bacteria use host-derived FABP2 to drive dysbiosis and worsen CD pathology. Targeting the FABP2-EF3041 axis may offer new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for managing CD.",

All activity scores improved in patients with endoscopic response compared to non-responders (P P = 0.1). The per-segment response was more accurately evaluated with BWT compared to the segmental MaRIA score (AUC=0.82 and 0.67, respectively; P = 0.05).

This comprehensive systematic review describes the prevalence, clinical presentation, and medical and surgical management of involvement of the upper GI tract in adult patients with Crohn's disease.MethodsA systematic review of available literature was conducted using the search engines Medline, Cochrane, and Embase, with pre-defined search algorithms. Studies published from 1947 to July 2024 were considered. The review included papers describing both clinical characteristics and the effectiveness of medical and interventional procedures in patients with UGICD. All included papers underwent quality appraisal using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist.ResultsFollowing screening and full-text review, 47 articles were eligible. The median prevalence of UGICD was found to be 8.7% (interquartile range, 4.74%-24.36%). Over one-third of patients with UGICD are asymptomatic, and abdominal pain was the most frequently reported symptom in symptomatic patients (41%; range, 5%-93%). Endoscopy is the most used diagnostic tool (96%), with the duodenum being the most common disease location (69%). Accepted definitions of UGICD within each diagnostic modality have not been devised. Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy appears to be efficacious for UGICD (overall clinical response, 81%). The current data are limited by the significant heterogeneity in study design and definitions between studies, particularly inconsistency in diagnosis and outcome measures used.ConclusionWe highlight the need for the development of standardized guidance in both diagnosing and managing UGICD.

Crohn's disease is a chronic disease that can involve both intestinal and extraintestinal areas, and severe patients have prolonged and poor prognosis, so early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for patients. This case is a combination of bacillary dysentery and Crohn's disease, which emphasizes the differentiation between bacillary dysentery and Crohn's disease, and expects clinicians to pay attention to and discover the early manifestations of Crohn's disease.Patient concernsA young male was admitted to the hospital with recurrent abdominal pain. Based on the patient's symptoms, imaging, enteroscopy, and pathology, we concluded that he had \"acute bacillary dysentery and Crohn's disease combined with bladder fistula.\"Diagnoses1. Acute bacillary dysentery, 2. Crohn's disease combined with bladder fistula, 3. urinary tract infection.InterventionsThe patient was treated with 390 mg intravenous infusion of ustekinumab, anti-infection, antispasmodic, regulation of intestinal flora, repair of intestinal mucosa, fluid rehydration, nutritional support, etc.OutcomesThe patient's abdominal pain was improved, no more blood in the stool, urinary frequency and pain were improved, and urine color was clear.LessonsIn the course of diagnosis and treatment, the patient's bacillary dysentery was clearly diagnosed, so the corresponding treatment was given, and there was a good effect in the treatment process, so the possibility of complications was not paid attention to. At the same time, Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic nonspecific inflammation of the intestine, which is difficult to diagnose. Moreover, some manifestations of CD under endoscopy are similar to those of bacillary dysentery, which increases the difficulty of diagnosis. In this case, the initial treatment of bacillary dysentery was good, but CD was found in the later stage when the disease was repeated and complications occurred, delaying the diagnosis and treatment of CD. Therefore, this paper reviewed part of the literature, summarized and identified the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, endoscopic manifestations, and pathological manifestations of bacillary dysentery and CD, hoping that clinicians can pay attention to and discover the early manifestations of CD.",

      "abstract": "Background & aimsDiets can help induce remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). However, given inconsistent recommendations across purportedly beneficial anti-inflammatory diets and prior studies highlighting benefits of plant-based diet patterns, we hypothesized that the benefit of diet therapy stems from the overall \"healthfulness\" of diet patterns.MethodsIn a randomized controlled trial, adults with mild-to-moderate CD were assigned to receive guidance on a natural whole food diet that comprised principles of a healthful diet versus continuation of one's habitual diet. Primary outcomes included clinical remission and change in calprotectin in weeks 4 and 8. Secondary outcomes included nutritional parameters (nutrient and energy intake, body composition, metabolic rate) and adverse events. Healthy Eating Index (HEI) served as a surrogate of diet quality and adherence.ResultsTwenty-eight participants with active CD were randomized. In intention-to-treat analysis, whole food diet led to overall greater clinical remission (odds ratio [OR] 1.41; 95 % CI 1.03-1.93; P = 0.03) and similar change in calprotectin. In per protocol analysis, adherence to a healthful diet was associated with clinical remission (OR 1.18; 95 % CI 1.02-1.38; P = 0.03) and change in calprotectin (-234; 95 % CI -465 to -3; P = 0.047).

      "abstract": "Introduction Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can involve any part from mouth to anus but predominantly involves the distal small intestine and proximal colon. Sarcopenia is recognized as muscle failure consequent to loss of skeletal muscle strength, function, and mass. Sarcopenia was found to be prevalent in CD patients. Objectives The primary objective of our study was to assess the prevalence of sarcopenia in CD patients, its correlation with disease activity, and the effect of sarcopenia on the prognosis of CD. The secondary objectives were to find out whether there is any correlation of sarcopenia with C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, and hemoglobin levels. Materials and methods This was a prospective cohort study done on 70 newly diagnosed CD patients in the Department of Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Kerala, India. Sarcopenia was assessed with the L3 skeletal muscle index (L3SMI) using a cross-sectional image at the L3 level from a cross-sectional image using Image J software. The cut-off of L3SMI was 2/m2. Prevalence of sarcopenia was 38.6% (n=27). The sarcopenia group had a younger age of disease onset (24.52 ± 8.22). Body mass index (BMI) was lower in the sarcopenia group (15.12 ± 1.33 kg/m2). Patients with sarcopenia had higher clinical disease severity according to the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score and higher endoscopic severity according to the simple endoscopic score (SES-CD score). Hemoglobin and albumin were lower, and CRP and ESR were higher in the sarcopenia group. Remission at six-month follow-up was 48.1% in the sarcopenia group and was lower when compared to the group without sarcopenia. The number of disease flares was higher in the sarcopenia group (1.07 ± 1.035).  Conclusion Sarcopenia is prevalent in CD patients. Patients with sarcopenia had higher clinical and endoscopic disease severity. There is decreased remission and an increased number of flares in patients with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia correlated with hemoglobin, albumin, CRP, and ESR.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota is significantly altered in stenotic intestines and may play a key role in the development of fibrogenesis in Crohn's disease. Additionally, the presence of hypertrophic mesenteric adipose tissue, also known as creeping fat, is closely correlated with intestinal stricture and fibrosis. Recent findings have revealed that bacterial translocation to creeping fat might exacerbate colitis and promote intestinal fibrosis. However, there is still a gap in determining whether gut microbiota links the formation of creeping fat to intestinal fibrosis.

Literature review was performed through the PubMed and Medline databases to identify studies pertinent to the wide-ranging focus of this review.Expert opinionEarly, individualized treatment combining medical and surgical strategies is crucial for optimizing outcomes in patients with CD-related abdominal abscesses. Antibiotics are effective for smaller abscesses in hemodynamically stable patients; however, recurrence is common, necessitating close monitoring. Percutaneous drainage (PD) provides a less invasive alternative to surgery, offering high initial success rates but variable long-term results, as many patients ultimately need a definitive surgical intervention. For larger or complex abscesses, surgery may be necessary to address both the abscess and underlying CD. Despite its invasiveness, surgery is associated with high success rates and reduced recurrence risk. Biologic therapies, particularly anti-TNF agents, have shown promise in managing CD-associated abscesses, and can reduce abscess recurrence risk without surgery. While biologics may help delay or avoid surgery in select patients, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to mitigate the risks associated with immunosuppression in the presence of intra-abdominal infections.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is an idiopathic and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The underlying pathogenesis of CD is multifaceted, with complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and abnormalities within the immune system. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have gained significant attention as a novel component in the pathogenesis of CD. NETs are intricate structures fashioned from DNA, histones, and granule proteins, and are actively released by neutrophils to entangle and eliminate pathogenic microbes. This review article delves into the intricate role of NETs in the pathogenesis of CD. We examine how NETs may serve as a pivotal mechanism for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation. NETs are known to influence the function of epithelial cells, which line the GI tract, potentially contributing to the structural integrity and barrier dysfunction observed in CD. NETs stimulate inflammation, a hallmark of the disease, by releasing pro-inflammatory molecules and activating immune cells. We also investigate the promising therapeutic potential of targeting NETs in CD. By intercepting the formation or function of NETs, it may be possible to mitigate the chronic inflammation, reduce tissue damage, and alleviate the symptoms associated with CD. Strategies to inhibit NET formation, such as the use of DNase I and approaches to disrupt NET-mediated signaling pathways, are discussed in CD therapeutics. Understanding the detailed mechanisms of NETs is crucial for the development of targeted treatments that could potentially revolutionize the management of CD.",

Our study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using a modified YOLOv5 algorithm for differentiating between cCD and UC on computed tomography enterography (CTE) images. Methods: This multicenter retrospective study analyzed data from a total of 29 cCD patients and 29 UC patients. Five submodels (YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x) of YOLOv5 were trained and evaluated on the datasets. The CTE images of the cCD group and UC group were divided into a training set, validation set, and test set at a ratio of 8:1:1. Finally, the precision (Pr), recall rate (Rc), and mean average precision (mAP_0.5 and mAP_0.5:0.95) of the models were compared. Results: The YOLOv5x model showed the best performance among the five submodels, with mAP_0.5 of 0.97 and mAP_0.5:0.95 of 0.97 and 0.84 in the validation set and mAP_0.5 and mAP_0.5:0.95 of 0.97 and 0.83 in the test set, respectively. These results demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy to the two radiologists (84.5%). Conclusion: The modified YOLOv5 algorithm is a feasible approach to distinguish between cCD and UC on CTE images.

      "abstract": "Abstract  Background Crohn's disease presents a persistent challenge, particularly concerning disease recurrence in patients after previous intestinal resection. This recurrence often necessitates additional medical treatment or surgery, imposing a substantial burden on patients, healthcare systems, and society. New research suggest that an extended mesenteric resection can reduce the risk of recurrence at the anastomotic site. The EXCEED project aims to investigate the mesentery's influence on disease recurrence in Crohn's disease, guided by emerging evidence indicating that incorporating the mesentery during ileocecal resections can markedly diminish recurrence rates. Methods/design The EXCEED study is a blinded multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial involving 208 patients. Patients will undergo randomization into two groups: Group A, the treatment group, will receive extended mesenteric resection, while Group B, the control group, will undergo the standard resection with the mesentery largely preserved. Stratification will occur based on preoperative medicinal treatment categories (none, immunological, biological) and the treatment facility at the time of inclusion. This randomized controlled trial will incorporate blinding procedures, with the understanding that due to the nature of this interventional surgical study, the operating surgeon cannot be blinded. The primary endpoint of this study is endoscopic signs of recurrence, defined as a modified Rutgeerts score >i2a, at the 12-month follow-up ileo-colonoscopy. Secondary endpoints include clinical recurrence at 6 and 12 months, as well as recurrence at 3 and 5 years postoperatively, evaluated through chart review Tertiary endpoints are the impact of disease severity at the time of operation, according to the Montreal classification, on recurrence rates. Impact of biological treatment on recurrence rates. Postoperative complications burden according to the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Patient reported outcome through questionnaires (5Q-5D-5L and SIBDQ) and cost-effectiveness analysis. Discussion This study addresses a critical gap in Crohn's disease literature, aiming to provide evidence on the impact of extended mesenteric excision in preventing disease recurrence, thereby contributing to enhanced patient outcomes.

Patients received 12-week mirikizumab induction (200, 600, or 1000 mg [SERENITY] or 900 mg [VIVID-1] intravenously [IV]) or placebo, every 4 weeks (Q4W), then maintenance (200, 600, or 1000 mg IV [SERENITY], 300 mg subcutaneously (SC) [SERENITY and VIVID-1], or placebo, Q4W) to Week 52. PK and ER for efficacy were analyzed using population PK and logistic regression models for Weeks 12 and 52 endpoints, respectively, and included analyses of covariate effects. Mirikizumab PK was best described by a two-compartment model, with first-order absorption for SC maintenance doses. Body weight, body mass index, serum albumin concentration, C-reactive protein, and disease severity had statistically significant effects on PK, while body weight and disease severity affected ER; these effects were not considered clinically relevant. Efficacy results of 900 mg mirikizumab in VIVID-1 aligned with SERENITY, which observed near-maximal efficacy at Week 12 with 600-1000 mg mirikizumab IV. Efficacy at Week 52 did not vary markedly with exposure during maintenance. There was no significant association between exposure and adverse events. These results support the selection of 900 mg mirikizumab IV Q4W for induction and 300 mg SC Q4W for maintenance in patients with CD, with no dose adjustment for patient factors required.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundVitamin K serves as a critical coenzyme in the γ-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, underscoring its essential role in the coagulation cascade. Deficiency of this fat-soluble vitamin is frequently observed in individuals with chronic gastrointestinal disorders, particularly those affecting nutrient absorption. If left untreated, long-term vitamin K deficiency can lead to serious complications, including an increased risk of bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and impaired bone mineralization. Given the potential severity of these outcomes, prompt recognition and treatment are imperative.Case reportAn 87-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease and bowel resection 30 years ago, in sustained remission, presented with cutaneous purpura and elevated prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Laboratory evaluation revealed low serum vitamin K levels and decreased activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, which were corrected with vitamin K supplementation.ConclusionThis case highlights that acquired vitamin K deficiency should be considered a potential cause of coagulopathy, even in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease and no active gastrointestinal symptoms. Our patient developed clinically significant bleeding decades after bowel resection, emphasizing that long-term nutritional consequences of gastrointestinal surgery may persist silently. Vigilance for vitamin K and other micronutrient deficiencies is essential in this population. Early recognition and supplementation can reverse coagulopathy, prevent haemorrhagic complications, and improve outcomes through regular monitoring and timely intervention.Learning pointsAn elderly patient with quiescent Crohn's disease and prior bowel resection developed severe vitamin K deficiency-related coagulopathy three decades after remission.Selective depression of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, X) with normal factor V and elevated factor VIII was identified, and coagulopathy resolved rapidly with vitamin K supplementation.This case underscores the importance of long-term monitoring for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease with a surgical history, even in prolonged remission.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal fibrosis is one of the most threatening complications of Crohn's disease (CD). Although our previous study identified the profibrotic role of amphiregulin (AREG) in intestinal fibrosis, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which AREG mediates intestinal fibrosis. Specimens from stenotic and non-stenotic lesions in CD patients were collected, alongside normal specimens from individuals with intestinal diverticula, for the assessment of AREG levels. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis model was established in wild type (WT) and Areg-knockout (Areg-/-) mice. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on human intestinal fibroblasts (HIFs) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, the single-cell RNA-seq data of full-thickness CD, obtained from Prof. Rieder, was reanalyzed. Elevated levels of AREG were detected at stenotic sites in patients with CD. Areg-/- colitis mice exhibited decreased intestinal fibrosis. AREG enhanced the activation and proliferation of HIFs by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. The inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway effectively suppressed AREG-induced activation and proliferation of HIFs and attenuated colitis-associated fibrosis in mice. In stricturing CD, inflammatory monocytes exhibited higher AREG levels, contributing to the activation and proliferation of intestinal fibroblasts. Adoptive transfer of Ly6chi inflammatory monocytes from WT but not Areg-/- mice exacerbated intestinal fibrosis in DSS-induced colitis mice. These findings reveal that inflammatory monocytes derived-AREG promotes intestinal fibrosis in experimental colitis and CD patients by promoting intestinal fibroblasts activation and proliferation through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Inflammatory monocytes serve as the primary source of AREG in stricturing CD, critically mediating fibroblast-related fibrotic progression in an AREG-dependent manner. Therefore, AREG, the PI3K/AKT pathway and inflammatory monocytes may serve as potential therapeutic targets for intestinal fibrosis in CD.",

Machine learning (twelve algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, and LightGBM) identified predictive microbial and metabolic features, with findings experimentally validated through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a murine TNBS-induced colitis model.ResultsNon-responders at baseline demonstrated significant microbial dysbiosis marked by β-diversity variation, depletion of Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Lachnospiraceae, and enrichment of Escherichia/Shigella. Metabolomic profiling identified 179 differentially abundant metabolites, including deficiencies in taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and perturbations in glycerophospholipid metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis pathways. Among single-omics models, the microbiome-based Linear Discriminant Analysis achieved optimal performance (test AUC = 0.805), surpassing metabolomics-only (best AUC = 0.634) and integrated multi-omics approaches (best AUC = 0.779). SHAP analysis revealed Bifidobacterium as the dominant protective predictor, with its depletion strongly associated with non-response. Mechanistically, MIMOSA2 analysis linked Bifidobacterium catenulatum to TCDCA production, while FMT from non-responders exacerbated murine colitis through Treg depletion and M1 macrophage polarization, confirming microbiome-driven immune dysregulation.ConclusionsThese findings establish gut microbiome composition, particularly Bifidobacterium abundance, as a critical determinant of anti-TNF response in CD, mediated through bile acid-dependent regulation of Treg/M1 macrophage homeostasis. While multi-omics integration did not enhance predictive performance, microbiome-based machine learning models offer clinically actionable biomarkers for treatment stratification, providing a roadmap for precision therapy to overcome biological resistance in inflammatory bowel disease.",

The patients were randomly divided into a modeling group (70%) and an internal validation group (30%), with an external validation group from January 2023 to March 2024. Univariate and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors, which were used to construct a nomogram model. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Additionally, further sensitivity analyses were performed.ResultsOne hundred seventy patients were included in the training group, while 64 were included in the external validation group. A binary logistic stepwise regression analysis revealed that the changes in the amplitudes of albumin (ALB) and fibrinogen (FIB) were independent risk factors for endoscopic improvement. A nomogram model was developed based on these risk factors. The area under the curve of the model for the training group, internal validation group, and external validation group were 0.802, 0.788, and 0.787, respectively. The average absolute errors of the calibration curves were 0.011, 0.016, and 0.018, respectively. DCA indicated that the model performs well in clinical practice. Additionally, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model has strong robustness and applicability.ConclusionOur study shows that changes in the amplitudes of ALB and FIB are effective predictors of endoscopic improvement in patients with CD during follow-up visits compared to their previous ones.",

Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study using a self-administered, semi-structured online questionnaire applied to pediatric Crohn’s Disease (CD) patients diagnosed&gt;3 years, aiming to assess the impact of living with CD. Results: 10 patients included, 80% female, mean age 15.4 years, mean disease duration of 5.2 years. All patients were in remission with mean PCDAI of 3 (±4.8) and a mean IMPACT III score of 81.1). All patients reported good disease knowledge and adequate coping. Emotional responses at diagnosis included relief (60%) and negative emotions (40%). During relapses, anxiety and fear were prevalent, with 40% struggling with relapses. Therapeutic changes and monitoring were viewed as beneficial (100%) but with concern; 70% found monitoring tests a negative experience. Daily life impact was reported by 20%, with school accomplishments affected during relapses (40%). Extracurricular activities were limited during active disease (40%). Concerns about the future were noted by 40%, with 30% believing CD might limit their future. Most patients described appropriate self-efficacy: 60% self-managed, while 30% relied on parents. Transition to adult care was deemed necessary. Conclusion: This study illustrates the overall impact of disease on pediatric CD patients. It reports significant emotional and daily life challenges. The findings underscore the importance of psychosocial well-being, ongoing mental health assessment, non-invasive monitoring, and holistic care, emphasizing the patient perspective in managing pediatric CD.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Current treatments, including 5-aminosalicylic acid and immunosuppressant, often have side effects and limited efficacy. Alternatively, herbal medication, particularly Ocimum tenuiflorum, has gained attention for its historical use in Ayurveda against gastrointestinal and renal issues, supported by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immune-modulatory properties. This study employs network pharmacology and molecular modelling to explore the multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms of O. tenuiflorum as a complementary therapeutic approach for addressing Crohn's disease. The ADME screening of O. tenuiflorum identified 24 compounds with 550 targets and 5142 CD unique disease genes were found. Overlapping revealed 259 common targets and helped to identify the top 10 potential targets. Enrichment analysis indicated O. tenuiflorum's management potential via PI3K-AKT pathway modulation. Furthermore, molecular modelling revealed synergistic effects of O. tenuiflorum with identified key targets. Our study demonstrates the multi-target (AKT1, MAPK3, PIK3R1, SRC and STAT3) and multi-pathway (PI3K-AKT, Jak-STAT, MAPK and mTOR signalling) mechanisms of O. tenuiflorum in combating CD, providing new insight for further research towards developing complementary therapies.",

Three protocolized biopsies were taken respectively from an ulcer edge, 7-mm, and 14-mm away from the ulcer edge in patients with discrete ileal ulcer(s). In patients with no ulcers as controls, the same 3-site biopsy protocol was applied in a randomly selected area of endoscopically-unremarkable terminal ileal mucosa. A blinded pathologist assessed mucosal inflammation in each biopsy using 3 validated histologic indices.ResultsTwenty-four participants had visible ulcer(s) on endoscopy and 12 served as no-ulcer controls. Of biopsies taken from an ulcer edge, only 67% showed histologic evidence of active (neutrophilic) inflammation, and 33% showed histologic features of ulcer or erosion; all were from either large (n = 4) or very large (n = 4) ulcers. In the no-ulcer controls, no biopsies showed histologic features of ulcer or erosion, but 8% showed active inflammation.ConclusionA striking discordance exists between endoscopic and histologic assessments for mucosal inflammation in patients with active ileal CD, even in biopsies targeted at an ulcer edge, while a higher concordance is seen in patients with no endoscopic disease activity. It remains unclear how to incorporate histologic disease activity into the treatment paradigm. Further research is needed to optimize biopsy protocols and histologic assessments for CD.",
